    "### Approach :\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theoretical Foundation: Black-Box Optimization**\n",
    "Since I cannot verify the gradients of the detector (or if the detector is non-differentiable/unknown), standard gradient-based attacks like FGSM are inapplicable. I therefore treat this as a **Black-Box Optimization** problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Genetic Algorithms (GA):**\n",
    "My approach draws from **Alzantot et al. (2018)**, who demonstrated that Genetic Algorithms can successfully break NLP classifiers by iteratively mutating texts (population-based search) to maximize a target class score.\n",
    "*   **Adaptation:** I replace simple synonym swapping with an **LLM-based Mutation Operator** (Gemini), allowing for more \"natural\" and syntactically coherent perturbations than traditional word-swap attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Reference:** Alzantot, M., et al. (2018). \"Generating Natural Language Adversarial Examples.\" *EMNLP*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Engineering for Constraints: \"Ultra-Low Resource\" Mode\n",
    "**The Challenge:** I have a strict API limit (20 free calls). A standard GA with a population of 50 and 100 generations would require 5,000 calls.\n",
    "**The Solution:**\n",
    "1.  **State Persistence:** I implement a JSON-based state machine (`ga_state.json`) to save progress after every generation. If the API fails or limits are hit, I resume exactly where I left off.\n",
    "2.  **Micro-Batching:** I run only 2 generations per execution.\n",
    "3.  **Elitist Selection:** I keep only the **Top-1** best candidate and generate strictly 3 mutations. This reduces cost from O(N \\times Gen) to a fixed **6 calls per run**.\n"

      "So prodigious have been the recent advancements in the biological arts—most signally those which would rewrite the very ledger of our lineage or lengthen the brittle thread of life past its ordained knot—that the ancient boundaries of our estate are now so distended as to render the very visage of our humanity well-nigh inscrutable. If these triumphs of the laboratory present a prospect most agreeable for the alleviation of human misery, they do, with an equal gravity, cast a shadow of peculiar darkness; for in the capacity to polish the corruptible frame, there reside the specter of a new inequality, and a reversion to those cold philosophies which would value the spirit by the mere texture of its earthly clay. It must, therefore, be the solemn province of the moralist to deliberate, and that with a trepidation not easily quelled, anent whether it be consistent with the laws of Heaven to fashion the unborn according to the fleeting whims of a parent, or to alter, by a stroke that no future age may undo, the hallowed germ of our universal kind. The swiftness of these revelations is such that the legislator and the divine are alike found in a state of breathless pursuit, laboring to raise some fragile fence of law which might, peradventure, uphold the dignity of the soul without extinguishing that necessary lamp of scientific inquiry. Thus do we find ourselves usurping a seat hitherto reserved for the Creator alone; and as we daily meddle with the very atoms of our being, it is of the last importance that we array ourselves in a garment of the deepest humility, lest our vanity should outrun our understanding in the governance of life’s most tremendous mysteries.\n"

      "Having now attained my third year of instruction at the Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, I find my inclinations—though nominally tethered to the mechanical arts—drawn with an irresistible force toward the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence. It has been my particular endeavor to scrutinize the inner workings of those agentic systems which, by integrating the nuances of human language with the precision of external tools, attempt a semblance of reason; yet, I am most profoundly occupied by the question of their frailty, observing with a keen eye how they might falter when confronted by the imperfections of a noisy and unpredictable world. Through a series of independent labors and scholarly apprenticeships, I have not only implemented the very architectures of the \"transformer\" from their first principles but have also navigated the complexities of reinforcement learning and the vast, structured pipelines of retrieval, thereby gaining a practical wisdom that transcends the mere benchmarks of the academy. My previous service as a researcher in the linguistic arts has further instilled in me a devotion to the rigors of reproducible evaluation and the delicate trade-offs between efficiency and reliability, a discipline I now wish to bring to the Precog Laboratory. It is my earnest hope that, by laboring alongside such learned peers, I might refine my understanding of these digital intellects and thus prepare myself for the eventual pursuit of a Doctorate, seeking to understand not merely how these systems are built, but how they may be rendered robust, aligned, and worthy of the great tasks to which they are summoned.\n"

This reflects a practical trade-off in real-world black-box adversarial attacks: achieving \"perfect\" masquerade ($>0.90$) often requires exponentially more resources than achieving \"plausible\" deniability ($>0.80$).\n",

Thus, it falls into the default \"Not Human (Novel)\" bucket.\n",
