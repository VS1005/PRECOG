"_Walt Whitman has somewhere a fine and just distinction between “loving by allowance” and “loving with personal love.” This distinction applies to books as well as to men and women; and in the case of the not very numerous authors who are the objects of the personal affection, it brings a curious consequence with it. There is much more difference as to their best work than in the case of those others who are loved “by allowance” by convention, and because it is felt to be the right and proper thing to love them. And in the sect--fairly large and yet unusually choice--of Austenians or Janites, there would probably be found partisans of the claim to primacy of almost every one of the novels. To some the delightful freshness and humour of_ Northanger Abbey, _its completeness, finish, and_ entrain, _obscure the undoubted critical facts that its scale is small, and its scheme, after all, that of burlesque or parody, a kind in which the first rank is reached with difficulty._ Persuasion, _relatively faint in tone, and not enthralling in interest, has devotees who exalt above all the others its exquisite delicacy and keeping. The catastrophe of_ Mansfield Park _is admittedly theatrical, the hero and heroine are insipid, and the author has almost wickedly destroyed all romantic interest by expressly admitting that Edmund only took Fanny because Mary shocked him, and that Fanny might very likely have taken Crawford if he had been a little more assiduous; yet the matchless rehearsal-scenes and the characters of Mrs. Norris and others have secured, I believe, a considerable party for it._ Sense and Sensibility _has perhaps the fewest out-and-out admirers; but it does not want them._",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.5979020979020979,0.45,7.625,3,0,2,15.083191489361706
"_I suppose, however, that the majority of at least competent votes would, all things considered, be divided between_ Emma _and the present book; and perhaps the vulgar verdict (if indeed a fondness for Miss Austen be not of itself a patent of exemption from any possible charge of vulgarity) would go for_ Emma. _It is the larger, the more varied, the more popular; the author had by the time of its composition seen rather more of the world, and had improved her general, though not her most peculiar and characteristic dialogue; such figures as Miss Bates, as the Eltons, cannot but unite the suffrages of everybody. On the other hand, I, for my part, declare for_ Pride and Prejudice _unhesitatingly. It seems to me the most perfect, the most characteristic, the most eminently quintessential of its author’s works; and for this contention in such narrow space as is permitted to me, I propose here to show cause._",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6392405063291139,0.6666666666666666,5.6,4,0,0,17.981194267515928
"_I think, however, though the thought will doubtless seem heretical to more than one school of critics, that construction is not the highest merit, the choicest gift, of the novelist. It sets off his other gifts and graces most advantageously to the critical eye; and the want of it will sometimes mar those graces--appreciably, though not quite consciously--to eyes by no means ultra-critical. But a very badly-built novel which excelled in pathetic or humorous character, or which displayed consummate command of dialogue--perhaps the rarest of all faculties--would be an infinitely better thing than a faultless plot acted and told by puppets with pebbles in their mouths. And despite the ability which Miss Austen has shown in working out the story, I for one should put_ Pride and Prejudice _far lower if it did not contain what seem to me the very masterpieces of Miss Austen’s humour and of her faculty of character-creation--masterpieces who may indeed admit John Thorpe, the Eltons, Mrs. Norris, and one or two others to their company, but who, in one instance certainly, and perhaps in others, are still superior to them._",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.671875,0.4444444444444444,8.25,1,0,5,17.209729729729734
"_For if her knowledge was not very extended, she knew two things which only genius knows. The one was humanity, and the other was art. On the first head she could not make a mistake; her men, though limited, are true, and her women are, in the old sense, “absolute.” As to art, if she has never tried idealism, her realism is real to a degree which makes the false realism of our own day look merely dead-alive. Take almost any Frenchman, except the late M. de Maupassant, and watch him laboriously piling up strokes in the hope of giving a complete impression. You get none; you are lucky if, discarding two-thirds of what he gives, you can shape a real impression out of the rest. But with Miss Austen the myriad, trivial, unforced strokes build up the picture like magic. Nothing is false; nothing is superfluous. When (to take the present book only) Mr. Collins changed his mind from Jane to Elizabeth “while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire” (and we know_ how _Mrs. Bennet would have stirred the fire), when Mr. Darcy “brought his coffee-cup back_ himself,” _the touch in each case is like that of Swift--“taller by the breadth of my nail”--which impressed the half-reluctant Thackeray with just and outspoken admiration. Indeed, fantastic as it may seem, I should put Miss Austen as near to Swift in some ways, as I have put her to Addison in others._",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6596638655462185,0.5853658536585366,4.5,3,0,2,7.274340248962655
"_This Swiftian quality appears in the present novel as it appears nowhere else in the character of the immortal, the ineffable Mr. Collins. Mr. Collins is really_ great; _far greater than anything Addison ever did, almost great enough for Fielding or for Swift himself. It has been said that no one ever was like him. But in the first place,_ he _was like him; he is there--alive, imperishable, more real than hundreds of prime ministers and archbishops, of “metals, semi-metals, and distinguished philosophers.” In the second place, it is rash, I think, to conclude that an actual Mr. Collins was impossible or non-existent at the end of the eighteenth century. It is very interesting that we possess, in this same gallery, what may be called a spoiled first draught, or an unsuccessful study of him, in John Dashwood. The formality, the under-breeding, the meanness, are there; but the portrait is only half alive, and is felt to be even a little unnatural. Mr. Collins is perfectly natural, and perfectly alive. In fact, for all the “miniature,” there is something gigantic in the way in which a certain side, and more than one, of humanity, and especially eighteenth-century humanity, its Philistinism, its well-meaning but hide-bound morality, its formal pettiness, its grovelling respect for rank, its materialism, its selfishness, receives exhibition. I will not admit that one speech or one action of this inestimable man is incapable of being reconciled with reality, and I should not wonder if many of these words and actions are historically true._",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6007751937984496,0.9111111111111111,5.8,3,0,1,12.793654188948306
"_The goodness of the minor characters in_ Pride and Prejudice _has been already alluded to, and it makes a detailed dwelling on their beauties difficult in any space, and impossible in this. Mrs. Bennet we have glanced at, and it is not easy to say whether she is more exquisitely amusing or more horribly true. Much the same may be said of Kitty and Lydia; but it is not every author, even of genius, who would have differentiated with such unerring skill the effects of folly and vulgarity of intellect and disposition working upon the common weaknesses of woman at such different ages. With Mary, Miss Austen has taken rather less pains, though she has been even more unkind to her; not merely in the text, but, as we learn from those interesting traditional appendices which Mr. Austen Leigh has given us, in dooming her privately to marry “one of Mr. Philips’s clerks.” The habits of first copying and then retailing moral sentiments, of playing and singing too long in public, are, no doubt, grievous and criminal; but perhaps poor Mary was rather the scapegoat of the sins of blue stockings in that Fordyce-belectured generation. It is at any rate difficult not to extend to her a share of the respect and affection (affection and respect of a peculiar kind; doubtless), with which one regards Mr. Collins, when she draws the moral of Lydia’s fall. I sometimes wish that the exigencies of the story had permitted Miss Austen to unite these personages, and thus at once achieve a notable mating and soothe poor Mrs. Bennet’s anguish over the entail._",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6188679245283019,0.5869565217391305,7.857142857142857,4,0,0,13.149327137546472
"_The Bingleys and the Gardiners and the Lucases, Miss Darcy and Miss de Bourgh, Jane, Wickham, and the rest, must pass without special comment, further than the remark that Charlotte Lucas (her egregious papa, though delightful, is just a little on the thither side of the line between comedy and farce) is a wonderfully clever study in drab of one kind, and that Wickham (though something of Miss Austen’s hesitation of touch in dealing with young men appears) is a not much less notable sketch in drab of another. Only genius could have made Charlotte what she is, yet not disagreeable; Wickham what he is, without investing him either with a cheap Don Juanish attractiveness or a disgusting rascality. But the hero and the heroine are not tints to be dismissed._",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6870229007633588,0.5454545454545454,7.333333333333333,1,0,0,19.00488549618321
"_Darcy has always seemed to me by far the best and most interesting of Miss Austen’s heroes; the only possible competitor being Henry Tilney, whose part is so slight and simple that it hardly enters into comparison. It has sometimes, I believe, been urged that his pride is unnatural at first in its expression and later in its yielding, while his falling in love at all is not extremely probable. Here again I cannot go with the objectors. Darcy’s own account of the way in which his pride had been pampered, is perfectly rational and sufficient; and nothing could be, psychologically speaking, a_ causa verior _for its sudden restoration to healthy conditions than the shock of Elizabeth’s scornful refusal acting on a nature_ ex hypothesi _generous. Nothing in even our author is finer and more delicately touched than the change of his demeanour at the sudden meeting in the grounds of Pemberley. Had he been a bad prig or a bad coxcomb, he might have been still smarting under his rejection, or suspicious that the girl had come husband-hunting. His being neither is exactly consistent with the probable feelings of a man spoilt in the common sense, but not really injured in disposition, and thoroughly in love. As for his being in love, Elizabeth has given as just an exposition of the causes of that phenomenon as Darcy has of the conditions of his unregenerate state, only she has of course not counted in what was due to her own personal charm._",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.610236220472441,0.6,6.333333333333333,2,0,0,15.00373015873016
"_Still, all this does not explain her charm, which, taking beauty as a common form of all heroines, may perhaps consist in the addition to her playfulness, her wit, her affectionate and natural disposition, of a certain fearlessness very uncommon in heroines of her type and age. Nearly all of them would have been in speechless awe of the magnificent Darcy; nearly all of them would have palpitated and fluttered at the idea of proposals, even naughty ones, from the fascinating Wickham. Elizabeth, with nothing offensive, nothing_ viraginous, _nothing of the “New Woman” about her, has by nature what the best modern (not “new”) women have by education and experience, a perfect freedom from the idea that all men may bully her if they choose, and that most will away with her if they can. Though not in the least “impudent and mannish grown,” she has no mere sensibility, no nasty niceness about her. The form of passion common and likely to seem natural in Miss Austen’s day was so invariably connected with the display of one or the other, or both of these qualities, that she has not made Elizabeth outwardly passionate. But I, at least, have not the slightest doubt that she would have married Darcy just as willingly without Pemberley as with it, and anybody who can read between lines will not find the lovers’ conversations in the final chapters so frigid as they might have looked to the Della Cruscans of their own day, and perhaps do look to the Della Cruscans of this._",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.562015503875969,0.7435897435897436,8.333333333333334,1,0,0,19.10868217054264

They were rather handsome; had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town; had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds; were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people of rank; and were, therefore, in every respect entitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother’s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6069364161849711,0.6333333333333333,8.5,8,0,0,19.15441860465116
"Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but, as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6666666666666666,0.26666666666666666,9.5,1,0,0,19.408695652173915
"His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table; nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years when he was tempted, by an accidental recommendation, to look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it, for half an hour; was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6896551724137931,0.5,7.666666666666667,3,0,0,12.415000000000003
"Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy’s regard, Bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion. In understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient; but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious; and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared; Darcy was continually giving offence.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.609375,0.6521739130434783,4.5,3,0,0,9.640625000000004
"The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty; but she smiled too much.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6991150442477876,0.47368421052631576,5.5,5,0,0,12.866438053097344
"Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so; but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they should not object to know more of.

"Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. The distinction had, perhaps, been felt too strongly. It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and, quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge; where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody.

"“Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections, “is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary.

"The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit was returned in due form. Miss Bennet’s pleasing manners grew on the good-will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards the two eldest. By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value, as arising, in all probability, from the influence of their brother’s admiration. It was generally evident, whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and an uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent.

"“It may, perhaps, be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, “to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all _begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement. In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show _more_ affection than she feels.

"“Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together.

"“Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But these are not Jane’s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined in company with him four times.

"“Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the least.

"Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley’s attention to her sister, Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty: he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of this she was perfectly unaware: to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.5885416666666666,0.68,6.833333333333333,2,0,0,12.614447717231226

"“Oh, certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and, besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half deserved.”",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.8051948051948052,0.21052631578947367,5.5,1,0,0,16.588636363636365

"“Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, “is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I daresay, it succeeds; but, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.”",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.9038461538461539,0.625,9.0,2,0,0,21.255384615384617
"Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones’s being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother’s proposal; and it was settled that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable.

"Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister’s room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own judgment of her situation. The note was immediately despatched, and its contents as quickly complied with.

"Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She would not listen, therefore, to her daughter’s proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss Bingley’s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour.

"Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part, indeed, without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward.

She was very equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it.

She attracted him more than he liked; and Miss Bingley was uncivil to _her_ and more teasing than usual to himself. He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should _now_ escape him--nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible that, if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday: and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.7384615384615385,0.5294117647058824,7.0,2,0,1,15.148076923076925
"On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost all, took place. Miss Bingley’s civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook hands with the former.

He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage.

"He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins’s admiration. The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised; and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet’s heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property. The dinner, too, in its turn, was highly admired; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its cookery was owing. But here he was set right by Mrs. Bennet, who assured him, with some asperity, that they were very well able to keep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He begged pardon for having displeased her.

"During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady Catherine de Bourgh’s attention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner; and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people, he knew, but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her. She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets upstairs.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.5536332179930796,0.32558139534883723,6.3,4,0,2,13.109302615193027
"“She is a most charming young lady, indeed. Lady Catherine herself says that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of, as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still resides with them.

I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess; and that the most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her.

"Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6193181818181818,0.425,8.0,4,0,0,26.71428571428571

"His plan did not vary on seeing them.

The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour’s _tête-à-tête_ with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. “As to her _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to say--she could not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her _eldest_ daughter she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.”",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6733333333333333,0.43333333333333335,5.2,3,0,4,13.65964383561644

Such doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house, he was used to be free from them there: his civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and go.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6235294117647059,0.38461538461538464,7.666666666666667,4,0,0,9.813333333333336

"“There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short, anything or nothing. Certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm unguarded temper, and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too freely. I can recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that he hates me.”",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6037735849056604,0.391304347826087,5.166666666666667,1,0,1,9.717920433996387

He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father’s active superintendence; and when, immediately before my father’s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_ as of affection to myself.”",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6319444444444444,0.5862068965517241,5.8,3,0,0,9.650931208053688

There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs. Philips’s supper party, but his manners recommended him to everybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him.

The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation. To the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others.

Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy’s look and behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single event, or any particular person; for though they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was, at any rate, a ball.

There was no help for it, however. Mr. Wickham’s happiness and her own was perforce delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins’s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors. The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities towards herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to _her_.

No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after; the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy.

The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted, for Mr. Darcy’s pleasure, in the Bingleys’ invitation to the officers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Mr. Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile,--",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6411764705882353,0.35714285714285715,8.0,2,0,1,11.373426919900911
"This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by Elizabeth; and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham’s absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make. Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham.

"But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; and, having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice. The two first dances, however, brought a return of distress: they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn, apologizing instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give.

"When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her, in a whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man often times his consequence. Elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in her neighbours’ looks their equal amazement in beholding it. They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and, at first, was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance.

"“I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,” he coldly replied.

Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for, as to Mr. Darcy’s using him ill, it is perfectly false: for, on the contrary, he has been always remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame; that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned; and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way.

Mr. Bingley’s defence of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I did before.”",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.8235294117647058,0.3,7.0,1,0,0,10.872857142857146
"She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley’s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them, and told her with great exultation, that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.7623762376237624,0.5,6.666666666666667,1,0,0,10.430407766990296
"“I have found out,” said he, “by a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation to my patroness. I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin Miss De Bourgh, and of her mother, Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before.

"Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased speaking, replied thus,--",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.7764705882352941,0.38461538461538464,8.5,2,0,1,11.781882022471915
"“I have no reason, I assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisfied with my reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying, that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine’s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.”",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.7567567567567568,0.7777777777777778,5.0,0,0,0,7.409333333333336
"In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother’s words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.7636363636363637,0.3333333333333333,5.0,1,0,0,11.075714285714287
"Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her.

"At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth’s eyes were fixed on her, with most painful sensations; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another. Mary’s powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at Jane to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however, impenetrably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint, and, when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,--",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.5641025641025641,0.2916666666666667,5.2727272727272725,8,0,2,11.080000000000002
"“If I,” said Mr. Collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however, to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The rector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family.” And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room. Many stared--many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and observed, in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.5703971119133574,0.7105263157894737,7.777777777777778,4,0,1,10.185703971119136
"To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough; and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6776859504132231,0.47368421052631576,8.0,2,0,0,17.776557377049176
"The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side; and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offered to introduce him to any young lady in the room. He assured her that, as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief object was, by delicate attentions, to recommend himself to her; and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins’s conversation to herself.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6357142857142857,0.3684210526315789,6.0,3,0,0,8.021338652482271

"The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a manœuvre of Mrs. Bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and, by so doing, threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene. Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “Lord, how tired I am!” accompanied by a violent yawn.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6363636363636364,0.43333333333333335,7.125,2,1,0,8.920097087378643
"When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation.

"Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins she thought with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure. Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6947368421052632,0.45,7.333333333333333,2,0,0,10.596857142857147
"The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business.

"“Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mother’s permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.”",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6853146853146853,0.4090909090909091,6.2,2,0,1,13.352197183098593

"“I am not now to learn,” replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the hand, “that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time. I am, therefore, by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.”",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.7625,0.5,7.0,1,0,0,10.38197530864198

I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make _me_ happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make _you_ so.

In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach.

"“When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and, perhaps, you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character.”",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.7176470588235294,0.5,11.0,1,0,0,33.6635294117647

My situation in life, my connections with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further consideration that, in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your portion is unhappily so small, that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications.

Mr. Collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.704,0.4166666666666667,9.5,1,0,0,20.245984251968512

"After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton, to inquire if Mr. Wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.

"Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and was opened immediately. The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady’s fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister’s countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages. Jane recollected herself soon; and putting the letter away, tried to join, with her usual cheerfulness, in the general conversation: but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her upstairs. When they had gained their own room, Jane, taking out her letter, said, “This is from Caroline Bingley: what it contains has surprised me a good deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again. You shall hear what she says.”",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.7209302325581395,0.3103448275862069,4.833333333333333,5,0,0,13.32850877192983
"She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst had a house. The next was in these words:--“‘I do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire except your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that.’” To these high-flown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament: it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley’s being there; and as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6896551724137931,0.37037037037037035,6.5,3,0,1,13.48295454545455

Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the case is this:--we are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been _one_ inter-marriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that, because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday; or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.”",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6084656084656085,0.44,5.4,4,0,1,12.258723404255324

After lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation of thinking that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again, and soon dining at Longbourn; and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration, that, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two full courses.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.7079646017699115,0.4117647058823529,8.5,2,0,0,13.989456521739132

"Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was very amiable; but Charlotte’s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of:--its object was nothing less than to secure her from any return of Mr. Collins’s addresses, by engaging them towards herself. Such was Miss Lucas’s scheme; and appearances were so favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon. But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character; for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that, if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise; for, though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.

The strangeness of Mr. Collins’s making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte’s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own; but she could not have supposed it possible that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage.

It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She could think of nothing else; and yet, whether Bingley’s regard had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends’ interference; whether he had been aware of Jane’s attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister’s situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.5914893617021276,0.3157894736842105,6.857142857142857,5,0,0,15.328389057750762

"“Nay,” said Elizabeth, “this is not fair. _You_ wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. _I_ only want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see of the world the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense.

You mentioned _two_ instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and saying your opinion of him is sunk.

What sister would think herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable? If they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy. Do not distress me by the idea.

Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with her Longbourn nieces.

When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it, of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth’s warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both.

"Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but, as he took up his abode with the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was now fast approaching; and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that she “_wished_ they might be happy.” Thursday was to be the wedding-day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother’s ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her out of the room.

Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over; and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been rather than what was. Charlotte’s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness: there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine’s behaviour was most friendly and obliging.

His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain. Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than in Charlotte’s, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.

But my feelings are not only cordial towards _him_, they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance. Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do.

She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan, and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There was novelty in the scheme; and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would, moreover, give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to Charlotte’s first sketch. She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter.

His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest, which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced, that, whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6535433070866141,0.8461538461538461,9.5,3,0,2,18.86460317460318
"Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable.

"It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner’s door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival: when they entered the passage, she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin’s appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and kindness.

"Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first subject was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to her minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however, to hope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley’s visit in Gracechurch Street, and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the acquaintance.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.782608695652174,0.26666666666666666,5.0,1,0,0,11.875349462365595

"At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the road, the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge, everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming, when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw instantly that her cousin’s manners were not altered by his marriage: his formal civility was just what it had been; and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious formality, to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife’s offers of refreshment.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6020408163265306,0.325,5.714285714285714,2,0,0,12.605064935064934
"From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows; but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband’s help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency, of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit.

I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here.

"In spite of having been at St. James’s, Sir William was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by silence: but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth’s mind; and, from the observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6927710843373494,0.3333333333333333,6.4,2,0,0,11.642908777969023

There was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly: her features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.719626168224299,0.6,7.0,1,0,0,10.557871559633032
"The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants, and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her Ladyship’s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater. He carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended first by him, and then by Sir William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all the dinnertime. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish and fearing she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6261682242990654,0.41379310344827586,6.857142857142857,2,0,1,12.687646713615027
"When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted. She inquired into Charlotte’s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady’s attention which could furnish her with an occasion for dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who, she observed to Mrs. Collins, was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl. She asked her at different times how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother’s maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions, but answered them very composedly.

It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the other day that I recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with her.

Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh’s being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to everything her Ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and apologizing if he thought he won too many. Sir William did not say much.

"When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose, the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins, gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered. The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr. Collins’s side, and as many bows on Sir William’s, they departed. As soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for Charlotte’s sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship’s praise into his own hands.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6644295302013423,0.16666666666666666,7.2,1,0,0,8.821315789473687
"Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter’s being most comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country: but when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration; for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards. Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a pleasanter aspect: but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6103286384976526,0.32432432432432434,6.25,4,0,0,14.795232558139535

"Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship, and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs. Collins’s joints of meat were too large for her family.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6838235294117647,0.2727272727272727,8.333333333333334,3,0,0,12.446463768115944

"The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the Collinses’ reach. This, however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough: there were half hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she had often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine’s curiosity.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6352201257861635,0.3939393939393939,8.0,1,0,0,16.91753164556962

Elizabeth had heard, soon after her arrival, that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks; and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley’s designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6797385620915033,0.6111111111111112,10.333333333333334,1,0,0,16.74188311688312

On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle, Lord ----; and, to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen them from her husband’s room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,--",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.7378640776699029,0.2631578947368421,6.0,2,0,3,9.111320754716985
"Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to Mrs. Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend, met her with every appearance of composure.

At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family.

"Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them: anything was a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins’s pretty friend had, moreover, caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her Ladyship, after a while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out,--",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.712,0.2777777777777778,4.666666666666667,3,0,1,14.036875000000002

I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a part of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit.

All field sports were over. Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be always within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration, of her former favourite, George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners, she believed he might have the best informed mind.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6445497630331753,0.2894736842105263,7.2,4,0,0,18.54619047619048
"But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage it was more difficult to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel Fitzwilliam’s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself seriously to work to find it out: she watched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success.

"In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam.

"More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park, unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought; and, to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him, at first, that it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time, therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even the third. It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance; for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third encounter that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins’s happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings, and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying _there_ too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter.

They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering. But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which, proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy’s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sister’s sufferings.

"While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door-bell; and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her. But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room. In a hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better. She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and then getting up walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began:--",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6853146853146853,0.391304347826087,5.714285714285714,1,0,1,9.29388888888889
"Elizabeth’s astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement, and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority, of its being a degradation, of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his suit.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6886792452830188,0.2631578947368421,6.0,1,0,0,11.045924528301889
"In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man’s affection, and though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand. As he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther; and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks and she said,--",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6273291925465838,0.20689655172413793,5.833333333333333,3,0,1,11.952018633540373
"“In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should be felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you. But I cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of short duration. The feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation.”",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6991150442477876,0.375,5.166666666666667,0,0,1,10.338214285714287
"Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth’s feelings dreadful.

"“I might as well inquire,” replied she, “why, with so evident a design of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even against your character? Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I have other provocations. You know I have. Had not my own feelings decided against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister?”",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6886792452830188,0.4,4.4,0,0,0,9.821396226415096
"“I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_.

"“But it is not merely this affair,” she continued, “on which my dislike is founded. Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself? or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?”",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.7638888888888888,0.16666666666666666,3.6666666666666665,0,0,0,7.420753424657537
"“And of your infliction,” cried Elizabeth, with energy; “You have reduced him to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty. You have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him. You have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule.”",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6533333333333333,0.2857142857142857,5.2,1,1,1,6.925243243243241
"“And this,” cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room, “is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed! But, perhaps,” added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards her, “these offences might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence. Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and just. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?”",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6745562130177515,0.39285714285714285,5.4,1,3,1,8.970213903743318
"“From the very beginning, from the first moment, I may almost say, of my acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that groundwork of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.”",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.7126436781609196,0.4117647058823529,8.0,1,0,0,34.887126436781614
"And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house. The tumult of her mind was now painfully great. She knew not how to support herself, and, from actual weakness, sat down and cried for half an hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by every review of it. That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy! that he should have been in love with her for so many months! so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend’s marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost incredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane, his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6135265700483091,0.4117647058823529,5.777777777777778,0,3,0,9.668177033492825
"Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened: it was impossible to think of anything else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy’s sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road. The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6814159292035398,0.19047619047619047,6.0,1,0,0,10.277438596491233
"After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park: he was moving that way; and fearful of its being Mr. Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the gate. He had by that time reached it also; and, holding out a letter, which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty composure, “I have been walking in the grove some time, in the hope of meeting you. Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?” and then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.5774647887323944,0.15789473684210525,6.25,3,0,0,8.107558139534884
"With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity, Elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written quite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise full. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated from Rosings, at eight o’clock in the morning, and was as follows:--",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.7878787878787878,0.26666666666666666,4.75,0,0,1,9.434117647058823
"“Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments, or renewal of those offers, which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes, which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written and read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I demand it of your justice.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6608695652173913,0.15,9.0,2,0,0,17.44754385964912
"Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of its contents. But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited. Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong prejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension; and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister’s insensibility she instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride and insolence.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.5879629629629629,0.2702702702702703,5.777777777777778,4,0,0,10.002032258064514
"But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham--when she read, with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition. Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, “This must be false! This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!”--and when she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not regard it, that she would never look in it again.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.7235772357723578,0.625,5.2,0,3,3,9.971077283372363
"In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on nothing, she walked on; but it would not do: in half a minute the letter was unfolded again; and collecting herself as well as she could, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence. The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own words. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory; and as she recalled his very words, it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other, and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did not err. But when she read and re-read, with the closest attention, the particulars immediately following of Wickham’s resigning all pretensions to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read on. But every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render Mr. Darcy’s conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.5392491467576792,0.4222222222222222,5.666666666666667,5,0,2,12.74560398505604
"The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to Mr. Wickham’s charge exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his entrance into the ----shire militia, in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life, nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.7560975609756098,0.38461538461538464,8.333333333333334,1,0,2,9.597619047619052
"himself. As to his real character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner, had established him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years’ continuance. But no such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address, but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin’s affairs and whose character she had no reason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his cousin’s corroboration.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.5527272727272727,0.2545454545454545,6.0,2,1,1,12.846793567443388
"She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself in their first evening at Mr. Philips’s. Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_ struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that _he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week. She remembered, also, that till the Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but herself; but that after their removal, it had been everywhere discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy’s character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.5952380952380952,0.17857142857142858,6.285714285714286,3,0,1,10.687770467836256
"How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned! His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything. His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive: he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in further justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair;--that, proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their acquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits;--that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued;--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling;--that had his actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley was incomprehensible.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.5748031496062992,0.4864864864864865,6.25,7,1,7,17.902115171650056
"“How despicably have I acted!” she cried. “I, who have prided myself on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameless distrust. How humiliating is this discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind. But vanity, not love, has been my folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away where either were concerned.

"From herself to Jane, from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy’s explanation _there_ had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again. Widely different was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to give in the other? He declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister’s attachment; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte’s opinion had always been. Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane. She felt that Jane’s feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great sensibility.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6377952755905512,0.35,5.833333333333333,2,0,0,9.610178571428573
"When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned, in tones of such mortifying, yet merited, reproach, her sense of shame was severe.

"The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It soothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered that Jane’s disappointment had, in fact, been the work of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she had ever known before.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.7368421052631579,0.3076923076923077,7.0,1,0,0,16.813666666666666

Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those things. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.”",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.632258064516129,0.43478260869565216,4.166666666666667,1,0,0,6.260512820512822
"Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey; and as she did not answer them all herself attention was necessary--which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours: whenever she was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.7441860465116279,0.6666666666666666,7.5,3,0,1,19.448529411764707
"Mr. Darcy’s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different. When she remembered the style of his address, she was still full of indignation: but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion. His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect: but she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret: and in the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin. They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother’s indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and completely under Lydia’s guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there for ever.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.5977443609022557,0.46938775510204084,5.363636363636363,7,0,0,12.55186963979417
"Anxiety on Jane’s behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy’s explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.717391304347826,0.42857142857142855,8.333333333333334,1,1,0,12.382876344086025
"Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent there; and her Ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.7176470588235294,0.3888888888888889,8.5,1,0,0,17.921470588235298
"“I know not, Miss Elizabeth,” said he, “whether Mrs. Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it. The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we have done everything in our power to prevent you spending your time unpleasantly.”",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.7,0.625,6.0,2,0,0,10.32899173553719

Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine’s family is, indeed, the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You see how continually we are engaged there.

Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking.

"Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprang. Poor Charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such society! But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion.

"At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr. Collins; and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown.

"It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy’s proposals. To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate, and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley, which might only grieve her sister further.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.7105263157894737,0.2857142857142857,10.0,0,0,0,24.278478260869566
"It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ----, in Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet’s carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman’s punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room upstairs.

It should not be said, that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers. There was another reason, too, for her opposition.

Miss Bennet’s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings.

"The tumult of Elizabeth’s mind was allayed by this conversation. She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish to talk again of either. But there was still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not relate the other half of Mr. Darcy’s letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend. Here was knowledge in which no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last encumbrance of mystery. “And then,” said she, “if that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself.

"The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was the last of the regiment’s stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments.

Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame.

"In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her, were it known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia’s general behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must be greater than at home.

"“Indeed, you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not of peculiar, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia’s character. Excuse me,--for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character will be fixed; and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous;--a flirt, too, in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger Kitty is also comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh, my dear father, can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?”",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6064814814814815,0.48717948717948717,4.333333333333333,4,1,2,10.542760633861551
"“Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known, you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three--very silly sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find women better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being there may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life.”",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.7019867549668874,0.631578947368421,4.222222222222222,2,0,2,7.167927927927931
"With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry.

"Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility. In Lydia’s imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers. She saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp: its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6311475409836066,0.21875,6.4,1,0,0,12.279404958677684

"Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure; for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified, and her preference secured, at any time, by their renewal.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6871165644171779,0.35714285714285715,7.6,3,0,0,13.921219512195126
"On the very last day of the regiment’s remaining in Meryton, he dined, with others of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good-humour, that, on his making some inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam’s and Mr. Darcy’s having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.7837837837837838,0.36363636363636365,9.0,1,0,0,15.423783783783787
"He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but, with a moment’s recollection, and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen him often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man, asked her how she had liked him.

"“Indeed!” cried Wickham, with a look which did not escape her. “And pray may I ask--” but checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, “Is it in address that he improves?

His pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe.

She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge him.

"When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs. Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible,--advice which there was every reason to believe would be attended to; and, in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.7043478260869566,0.5,6.25,2,0,1,11.914000000000001
"Had Elizabeth’s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance of good-humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect, esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6231155778894473,0.40425531914893614,6.714285714285714,3,0,0,13.93834888729361
"Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her father’s behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents--talents which, rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.656934306569343,0.44,10.666666666666666,1,0,1,21.45185185185186
"When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham’s departure, she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and sister, whose constant repinings at the dulness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire, did not, in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts: it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6,0.41509433962264153,8.6,4,0,0,21.964131147540986

But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister’s absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized.

"When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and always very short. Those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going to the camp; and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less to be learnt, for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words to be made public.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6402877697841727,0.8666666666666667,6.5,3,0,0,18.708571428571428
"After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good-humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and by the middle of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears,--an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope, that by the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered in Meryton.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.7520661157024794,0.5217391304347826,5.75,1,0,1,15.552540983606558

Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the present plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire. In that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the Peak.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6224489795918368,0.3076923076923077,8.0,4,0,0,13.414346733668342

"The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.

It was not in their direct road; nor more than a mile or two out of it. In talking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again.

A most welcome negative followed the last question; and her alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike to the scheme.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6796116504854369,0.3333333333333333,5.5,2,0,0,21.79402912621359

They gradually ascended for half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of the valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills; and in front a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste.

It was a large, well-proportioned room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, from which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with delight. As they passed into other rooms, these objects were taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be seen.

How much of good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character; and as she stood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before: she remembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6513157894736842,0.2727272727272727,5.428571428571429,1,3,0,9.684436274509803
"As they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also; and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.75,0.1111111111111111,8.0,2,0,0,21.255384615384617
"They were within twenty yards of each other; and so abrupt was his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.8055555555555556,0.6666666666666666,5.666666666666667,2,0,0,12.289444444444445
"She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach, received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener’s expression of surprise, on beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she returned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few minutes in which they continued together were some of the most uncomfortable of her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his inquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6504854368932039,0.37142857142857144,8.0,4,0,0,16.163550724637684
"The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own feelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and vexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world! How strange must it appear to him! In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come? or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so strikingly altered,--what could it mean? That he should even speak to her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her family! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to account for it.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.5818965517241379,0.3142857142857143,3.9375,2,8,2,6.396671137339055
"They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching: but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then was. She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything, she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with composure.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6129032258064516,0.23333333333333334,6.6,3,0,0,12.024893048128344
"Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends. This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had revolted, in his offer to herself. “What will be his surprise,” thought she, “when he knows who they are! He takes them now for people of fashion.”",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.7222222222222222,0.23076923076923078,6.75,2,1,0,9.102280219780223
"The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the connection was evident: he sustained it, however, with fortitude: and, so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence, his taste, or his good manners.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6888888888888889,0.3684210526315789,6.6,2,0,0,12.718000000000004
"The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her wonder. Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme; and continually was she repeating, “Why is he so altered? From what can it proceed? It cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake that his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this. It is impossible that he should still love me.”",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6802721088435374,0.2608695652173913,4.0,3,0,0,8.118775510204085
"After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found Elizabeth’s arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred her husband’s. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on together. After a short silence the lady first spoke. She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very unexpected--“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and, indeed, before we left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country.” He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. “They will join me early to-morrow,” he continued, “and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.”",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.631578947368421,0.1891891891891892,5.625,2,0,2,11.547142857142855
"The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her, must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.7285714285714285,0.5714285714285714,6.0,2,0,0,15.422857142857143
"They now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others; and when they had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.7419354838709677,0.3,4.25,4,0,0,5.995750000000001
"He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but there seemed an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dovedale with great perseverance.

"On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness.

"“From what we have seen of him,” continued Mrs. Gardiner, “I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look. On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the good lady who showed us the house did give him a most flaming character! I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal master, I suppose, and _that_, in the eye of a servant, comprehends every virtue.”",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6890756302521008,0.5882352941176471,4.285714285714286,0,1,0,6.374275210084033
"Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and, therefore, gave them to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham’s so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6981132075471698,0.5,7.5,2,0,0,23.893207547169812
"Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned: but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of anything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning’s walk, they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years’ discontinuance.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.7142857142857143,0.3333333333333333,9.0,1,0,0,19.793478260869566
"Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was, consequently, resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning. But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own arrival at Lambton these visitors came. They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth, immediately recognizing the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of Elizabeth’s feelings was every moment increasing. She was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but, amongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.5899280575539568,0.30357142857142855,7.625,5,0,0,14.326450839328537
"Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.7534246575342466,0.8888888888888888,4.75,1,0,0,10.27818493150685
"Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother, but there was sense and good-humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such different feelings.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.7088607594936709,1.2,5.0,1,0,0,10.484651898734182
"They had not been long together before Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley’s quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All Elizabeth’s anger against him had been long done away; but had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He inquired in a friendly, though general, way, after her family, and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.7079646017699115,0.5,7.0,2,0,0,15.82714285714286
"To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards each with an earnest, though guarded, inquiry; and they soon drew from those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love. Of the lady’s sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.7578947368421053,0.4666666666666667,3.8,2,0,0,9.082040816326533
"Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were pre-possessed in her favour.

"In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh! how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But, though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of Jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that it “was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;” and, before she could reply, he added, “It is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.”",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6008771929824561,0.42857142857142855,6.2,3,1,0,10.66783114992722
"Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn.

"It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far removed from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6123348017621145,0.375,9.666666666666666,2,0,0,23.956596916299564
"Their visitors stayed with them above half an hour; and when they arose to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming, however, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.7318840579710145,0.391304347826087,9.0,1,0,0,12.17098591549296
"Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction, though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.7058823529411765,0.5789473684210527,7.333333333333333,1,0,0,17.431260504201678
"But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s curiosity; it was not their wish to force her communication.

"Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servant’s report, without any reference to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest, however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant, who had known him since he was four years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town where the family did not visit.

"By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a courtesy; and on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on.

She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room: she wished, she feared, that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing Miss Bingley’s voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry after the health of her family.

"The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected them round the table.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.7666666666666667,0.3684210526315789,9.5,3,0,0,12.837802197802201
"While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to regret that he came.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.8461538461538461,0.16666666666666666,11.0,1,0,0,12.778962264150948
"He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river; and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley’s, in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother’s entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded, as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,--",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6320754716981132,0.34375,8.333333333333334,5,0,2,14.526693121693125
"In Darcy’s presence she dared not mention Wickham’s name: but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment’s distress; but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone. While she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy with a heightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy’s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy’s meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley’s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan; and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6023166023166023,0.35,7.666666666666667,5,0,0,20.206356589147287
"Elizabeth’s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair; and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.7763157894736842,0.3333333333333333,6.5,2,0,0,17.861578947368418
"Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage, Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth’s person, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her brother’s recommendation was enough to insure her favour: his judgment could not err; and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable.

Her nose wants character; there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive anything extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable.”",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.7075471698113207,0.5882352941176471,5.0,5,0,0,8.895238095238096
"Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected.

"Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been mis-sent elsewhere.

"“Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you--be assured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia. An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood. Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing. Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How thankful am I, that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly know what I have written.”",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.5836298932384342,0.8518518518518519,4.05,3,2,1,6.049066308243727
"“Oh! where, where is my uncle?” cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself enough to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia’s situation, hastily exclaimed, “I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.

"Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her power was sinking; everything _must_ sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither wonder nor condemn; but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be vain.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.7652173913043478,0.21739130434782608,5.333333333333333,4,0,0,10.037543859649123

"As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.8082191780821918,0.46153846153846156,10.0,1,0,0,31.630684931506853
"If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth’s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorize her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia’s infamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business. Never since reading Jane’s second letter had she entertained a hope of Wickham’s meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least of all her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise, all astonishment, that Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.5963636363636363,0.4583333333333333,5.181818181818182,3,0,0,14.73466666666667
"She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her opinion. Her affections had been continually fluctuating, but never without an object.

"She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia, her uncle’s interference seemed of the utmost importance, and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience was severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing, by the servant’s account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy. Though Lydia had never been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply affected. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit, everything relating to their journey was speedily settled. They were to be off as soon as possible. “But what is to be done about Pemberley?” cried Mrs. Gardiner. “John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for us;--was it so?”",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6434782608695652,0.3939393939393939,5.75,6,0,2,11.135090141925584
"But wishes were vain; or, at best, could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr. Gardiner, meanwhile, having settled his account at the inn, nothing remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6521739130434783,0.391304347826087,8.0,4,0,0,14.601348920863312
"“I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,” said her uncle, as they drove from the town; “and really, upon serious consideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who was actually staying in his Colonel’s family, that I am strongly inclined to hope the best.

His most particular friend, you see by Jane’s account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father’s behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would do as little and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a matter.”",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6153846153846154,0.3870967741935484,4.25,2,0,1,8.188478568064063

But, really, I know not what to say. Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young: she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year, nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way. Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers, have been in her head. She has been doing everything in her power, by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greater--what shall I call it?--susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough.

And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless.

As that was the case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to anyone, that the good opinion, which all the neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown? And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me.

He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her.

"When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly useless; for, of course, they were to have a son. This son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs. Bennet, for many years after Lydia’s birth, had been certain that he would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving.

"Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with regard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser, by the hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mother’s hands, Lydia’s expenses had been very little within that sum.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6022099447513812,0.20588235294117646,7.333333333333333,1,0,0,10.612124316939894

No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and servants.

He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe possible.

She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6952380952380952,0.42857142857142855,5.5,3,0,0,21.96690476190476

Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable.

She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their mother talked on of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr. Bingley’s friend, without being heard by either of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not yet be suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to show Mrs. Gardiner’s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merits she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as what Jane felt for Bingley.

She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse; but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did.

Two obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any impression on them.

There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the evening Mrs. Bennet’s invention was again at work to get everybody away from him and her daughter.

"One morning, about a week after Bingley’s engagement with Jane had been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors; and besides, the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the shrubbery.

It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley, and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together.

She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her Ladyship than _she_ could do; and it was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_ whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side.

"Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine’s visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the habit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining five set off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy were to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution; and, perhaps, he might be doing the same.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.7077922077922078,0.7142857142857143,5.428571428571429,4,0,0,9.176390658174096

The happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do.

Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only _child_), I was spoiled by my parents, who, though good themselves, (my father particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to _wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I was, from eight to eight-and-twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you!

But _now_ suppose as much as you choose; give a loose to your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot greatly err. You must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last. I thank you again and again, for not going to the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your idea of the ponies is delightful. We will go round the park every day. I am the happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so before, but no one with such justice.

"Miss Bingley’s congratulations to her brother on his approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.7272727272727273,0.4444444444444444,5.333333333333333,1,0,0,11.04757575757576
"Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew’s letter, that Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St. James’s, with very decent composure. If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6781609195402298,0.3103448275862069,5.857142857142857,0,0,0,9.579666666666665
"Mrs. Philips’s vulgarity was another, and, perhaps, a greater tax on his forbearance; and though Mrs. Philips, as well as her sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley’s good-humour encouraged; yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar. Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6234567901234568,0.5652173913043478,7.0,4,0,0,17.676733128834353
"Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may be guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though, perhaps, it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.7232142857142857,0.7647058823529411,7.666666666666667,1,0,0,10.141052631578948

She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia’s example, she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia’s society she was of course carefully kept; and though Mrs. Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6442307692307693,0.5263157894736842,6.25,2,0,0,11.817142857142859

"As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and, in spite of everything, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune.

"As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind. Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expenses, she frequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the extreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection for her soon sunk into indifference: hers lasted a little longer; and, in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her. Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth’s sake, he assisted him further in his profession. Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently stayed so long, that even Bingley’s good-humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6083650190114068,0.29545454545454547,6.75,3,0,0,14.882500000000004

"Pemberley was now Georgiana’s home; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each other, even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive manner of talking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way.

But at length, by Elizabeth’s persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.",Human,Jane Austen,Original Novel,0.6293706293706294,0.15151515151515152,8.5,3,0,0,30.201293706293708
"I am a rather elderly man. The nature of my avocations for the last thirty years has brought me into more than ordinary contact with what would seem an interesting and somewhat singular set of men, of whom as yet nothing that I know of has ever been written:—I mean the law-copyists or scriveners. I have known very many of them, professionally and privately, and if I pleased, could relate divers histories, at which good-natured gentlemen might smile, and sentimental souls might weep. But I waive the biographies of all other scriveners for a few passages in the life of Bartleby, who was a scrivener of the strangest I ever saw or heard of. While of other law-copyists I might write the complete life, of Bartleby nothing of that sort can be done. I believe that no materials exist for a full and satisfactory biography of this man. It is an irreparable loss to literature. Bartleby was one of those beings of whom nothing is ascertainable, except from the original sources, and in his case those are very small.

"My chambers were up stairs at No.—Wall-street. At one end they looked upon the white wall of the interior of a spacious sky-light shaft, penetrating the building from top to bottom. This view might have been considered rather tame than otherwise, deficient in what landscape painters call “life.” But if so, the view from the other end of my chambers offered, at least, a contrast, if nothing more. In that direction my windows commanded an unobstructed view of a lofty brick wall, black by age and everlasting shade; which wall required no spy-glass to bring out its lurking beauties, but for the benefit of all near-sighted spectators, was pushed up to within ten feet of my window panes.

"Though concerning the self-indulgent habits of Turkey I had my own private surmises, yet touching Nippers I was well persuaded that whatever might be his faults in other respects, he was, at least, a temperate young man. But indeed, nature herself seemed to have been his vintner, and at his birth charged him so thoroughly with an irritable, brandy-like disposition, that all subsequent potations were needless. When I consider how, amid the stillness of my chambers, Nippers would sometimes impatiently rise from his seat, and stooping over his table, spread his arms wide apart, seize the whole desk, and move it, and jerk it, with a grim, grinding motion on the floor, as if the table were a perverse voluntary agent, intent on thwarting and vexing him; I plainly perceive that for Nippers, brandy and water were altogether superfluous.",Human,Herman Melville,Original Novel,0.75177304964539,0.782608695652174,7.0,1,0,0,20.307338129496404

"I should have stated before that ground glass folding-doors divided my premises into two parts, one of which was occupied by my scriveners, the other by myself. According to my humor I threw open these doors, or closed them. I resolved to assign Bartleby a corner by the folding-doors, but on my side of them, so as to have this quiet man within easy call, in case any trifling thing was to be done. I placed his desk close up to a small side-window in that part of the room, a window which originally had afforded a lateral view of certain grimy back-yards and bricks, but which, owing to subsequent erections, commanded at present no view at all, though it gave some light. Within three feet of the panes was a wall, and the light came down from far above, between two lofty buildings, as from a very small opening in a dome. Still further to a satisfactory arrangement, I procured a high green folding screen, which might entirely isolate Bartleby from my sight, though not remove him from my voice.

It is a very dull, wearisome, and lethargic affair. I can readily imagine that to some sanguine temperaments it would be altogether intolerable.

It was on the third day, I think, of his being with me, and before any necessity had arisen for having his own writing examined, that, being much hurried to complete a small affair I had in hand, I abruptly called to Bartleby.

He was a perpetual sentry in the corner. At about eleven o’clock though, in the morning, I noticed that Ginger Nut would advance toward the opening in Bartleby’s screen, as if silently beckoned thither by a gesture invisible to me where I sat.

Ginger-nuts are so called because they contain ginger as one of their peculiar constituents, and the final flavoring one. Now what was ginger? A hot, spicy thing. Was Bartleby hot and spicy?

If the individual so resisted be of a not inhumane temper, and the resisting one perfectly harmless in his passivity; then, in the better moods of the former, he will endeavor charitably to construe to his imagination what proves impossible to be solved by his judgment.

Poor fellow! thought I, he means no mischief; it is plain he intends no insolence; his aspect sufficiently evinces that his eccentricities are involuntary. He is useful to me. I can get along with him. If I turn him away, the chances are he will fall in with some less indulgent employer, and then he will be rudely treated, and perhaps driven forth miserably to starve. Yes. Here I can cheaply purchase a delicious self-approval. To befriend Bartleby; to humor him in his strange willfulness, will cost me little or nothing, while I lay up in my soul what will eventually prove a sweet morsel for my conscience. But this mood was not invariable with me. The passiveness of Bartleby sometimes irritated me. I felt strangely goaded on to encounter him in new opposition, to elicit some angry spark from him answerable to my own. But indeed I might as well have essayed to strike fire with my knuckles against a bit of Windsor soap. But one afternoon the evil impulse in me mastered me, and the following little scene ensued:",Human,Herman Melville,Original Novel,0.624,0.7352941176470589,3.3529411764705883,4,1,0,9.544018932874355
"I staggered to my desk, and sat there in a deep study. My blind inveteracy returned.

"“Very good, Bartleby,” said I, in a quiet sort of serenely severe self-possessed tone, intimating the unalterable purpose of some terrible retribution very close at hand. At the moment I half intended something of the kind. But upon the whole, as it was drawing towards my dinner-hour, I thought it best to put on my hat and walk home for the day, suffering much from perplexity and distress of mind.",Human,Herman Melville,Original Novel,0.8055555555555556,0.3125,6.333333333333333,0,0,0,11.715714285714288
"Shall I acknowledge it? The conclusion of this whole business was, that it soon became a fixed fact of my chambers, that a pale young scrivener, by the name of Bartleby, and a desk there; that he copied for me at the usual rate of four cents a folio (one hundred words); but he was permanently exempt from examining the work done by him, that duty being transferred to Turkey and Nippers, one of compliment doubtless to their superior acuteness; moreover, said Bartleby was never on any account to be dispatched on the most trivial errand of any sort; and that even if entreated to take upon him such a matter, it was generally understood that he would prefer not to—in other words, that he would refuse pointblank.",Human,Herman Melville,Original Novel,0.6821705426356589,0.42857142857142855,6.5,4,0,1,26.609062499999997
"As days passed on, I became considerably reconciled to Bartleby. His steadiness, his freedom from all dissipation, his incessant industry (except when he chose to throw himself into a standing revery behind his screen), his great stillness, his unalterableness of demeanor under all circumstances, made him a valuable acquisition. One prime thing was this,—_he was always there;_—first in the morning, continually through the day, and the last at night. I had a singular confidence in his honesty. I felt my most precious papers perfectly safe in his hands. Sometimes to be sure I could not, for the very soul of me, avoid falling into sudden spasmodic passions with him. For it was exceeding difficult to bear in mind all the time those strange peculiarities, privileges, and unheard of exemptions, forming the tacit stipulations on Bartleby’s part under which he remained in my office. Now and then, in the eagerness of dispatching pressing business, I would inadvertently summon Bartleby, in a short, rapid tone, to put his finger, say, on the incipient tie of a bit of red tape with which I was about compressing some papers. Of course, from behind the screen the usual answer, “I prefer not to,” was sure to come; and then, how could a human creature with the common infirmities of our nature, refrain from bitterly exclaiming upon such perverseness—such unreasonableness. However, every added repulse of this sort which I received only tended to lessen the probability of my repeating the inadvertence.",Human,Herman Melville,Original Novel,0.6408163265306123,0.52,5.9,2,0,3,13.190991869918701
"Here it must be said, that according to the custom of most legal gentlemen occupying chambers in densely-populated law buildings, there were several keys to my door. One was kept by a woman residing in the attic, which person weekly scrubbed and daily swept and dusted my apartments. Another was kept by Turkey for convenience sake.

"Now, one Sunday morning I happened to go to Trinity Church, to hear a celebrated preacher, and finding myself rather early on the ground, I thought I would walk around to my chambers for a while. Luckily I had my key with me; but upon applying it to the lock, I found it resisted by something inserted from the inside. Quite surprised, I called out; when to my consternation a key was turned from within; and thrusting his lean visage at me, and holding the door ajar, the apparition of Bartleby appeared, in his shirt sleeves, and otherwise in a strangely tattered dishabille, saying quietly that he was sorry, but he was deeply engaged just then, and—preferred not admitting me at present. In a brief word or two, he moreover added, that perhaps I had better walk round the block two or three times, and by that time he would probably have concluded his affairs.",Human,Herman Melville,Original Novel,0.6730769230769231,0.2727272727272727,6.75,3,0,1,16.34701612903226
"Now, the utterly unsurmised appearance of Bartleby, tenanting my law-chambers of a Sunday morning, with his cadaverously gentlemanly _nonchalance_, yet withal firm and self-possessed, had such a strange effect upon me, that incontinently I slunk away from my own door, and did as desired. But not without sundry twinges of impotent rebellion against the mild effrontery of this unaccountable scrivener. Indeed, it was his wonderful mildness chiefly, which not only disarmed me, but unmanned me, as it were. For I consider that one, for the time, is a sort of unmanned when he tranquilly permits his hired clerk to dictate to him, and order him away from his own premises. Furthermore, I was full of uneasiness as to what Bartleby could possibly be doing in my office in his shirt sleeves, and in an otherwise dismantled condition of a Sunday morning. Was any thing amiss going on? Nay, that was out of the question. It was not to be thought of for a moment that Bartleby was an immoral person. But what could he be doing there?—copying? Nay again, whatever might be his eccentricities, Bartleby was an eminently decorous person. He would be the last man to sit down to his desk in any state approaching to nudity. Besides, it was Sunday; and there was something about Bartleby that forbade the supposition that he would by any secular occupation violate the proprieties of the day.",Human,Herman Melville,Original Novel,0.5847457627118644,0.42857142857142855,5.416666666666667,1,0,1,10.676436170212767
"Nevertheless, my mind was not pacified; and full of a restless curiosity, at last I returned to the door. Without hindrance I inserted my key, opened it, and entered. Bartleby was not to be seen. I looked round anxiously, peeped behind his screen; but it was very plain that he was gone. Upon more closely examining the place, I surmised that for an indefinite period Bartleby must have ate, dressed, and slept in my office, and that too without plate, mirror, or bed. The cushioned seat of a rickety old sofa in one corner bore the faint impress of a lean, reclining form. Rolled away under his desk, I found a blanket; under the empty grate, a blacking box and brush; on a chair, a tin basin, with soap and a ragged towel; in a newspaper a few crumbs of ginger-nuts and a morsel of cheese. Yes, thought I, it is evident enough that Bartleby has been making his home here, keeping bachelor’s hall all by himself. Immediately then the thought came sweeping across me, What miserable friendlessness and loneliness are here revealed! His poverty is great; but his solitude, how horrible! Think of it. Of a Sunday, Wall-street is deserted as Petra; and every night of every day it is an emptiness. This building too, which of week-days hums with industry and life, at nightfall echoes with sheer vacancy, and all through Sunday is forlorn. And here Bartleby makes his home; sole spectator of a solitude which he has seen all populous—a sort of innocent and transformed Marius brooding among the ruins of Carthage!",Human,Herman Melville,Original Novel,0.6431226765799256,0.31746031746031744,4.857142857142857,8,3,1,9.113652291105119
"For the first time in my life a feeling of overpowering stinging melancholy seized me. Before, I had never experienced aught but a not-unpleasing sadness. The bond of a common humanity now drew me irresistibly to gloom. A fraternal melancholy! For both I and Bartleby were sons of Adam. I remembered the bright silks and sparkling faces I had seen that day, in gala trim, swan-like sailing down the Mississippi of Broadway; and I contrasted them with the pallid copyist, and thought to myself, Ah, happiness courts the light, so we deem the world is gay; but misery hides aloof, so we deem that misery there is none. These sad fancyings—chimeras, doubtless, of a sick and silly brain—led on to other and more special thoughts, concerning the eccentricities of Bartleby. Presentiments of strange discoveries hovered round me. The scrivener’s pale form appeared to me laid out, among uncaring strangers, in its shivering winding sheet.",Human,Herman Melville,Original Novel,0.7088607594936709,0.5,4.222222222222222,2,1,2,9.396320346320348
"I mean no mischief, seek the gratification of no heartless curiosity, thought I; besides, the desk is mine, and its contents too, so I will make bold to look within. Every thing was methodically arranged, the papers smoothly placed. The pigeon holes were deep, and removing the files of documents, I groped into their recesses. Presently I felt something there, and dragged it out. It was an old bandanna handkerchief, heavy and knotted. I opened it, and saw it was a savings’ bank.",Human,Herman Melville,Original Novel,0.7590361445783133,0.23529411764705882,3.6666666666666665,1,0,0,7.433915662650602
"I now recalled all the quiet mysteries which I had noted in the man. I remembered that he never spoke but to answer; that though at intervals he had considerable time to himself, yet I had never seen him reading—no, not even a newspaper; that for long periods he would stand looking out, at his pale window behind the screen, upon the dead brick wall; I was quite sure he never visited any refectory or eating house; while his pale face clearly indicated that he never drank beer like Turkey, or tea and coffee even, like other men; that he never went any where in particular that I could learn; never went out for a walk, unless indeed that was the case at present; that he had declined telling who he was, or whence he came, or whether he had any relatives in the world; that though so thin and pale, he never complained of ill health. And more than all, I remembered a certain unconscious air of pallid—how shall I call it?—of pallid haughtiness, say, or rather an austere reserve about him, which had positively awed me into my tame compliance with his eccentricities, when I had feared to ask him to do the slightest incidental thing for me, even though I might know, from his long-continued motionlessness, that behind his screen he must be standing in one of those dead-wall reveries of his.",Human,Herman Melville,Original Novel,0.5882352941176471,0.696969696969697,7.0,8,0,3,24.24420212765958
"Revolving all these things, and coupling them with the recently discovered fact that he made my office his constant abiding place and home, and not forgetful of his morbid moodiness; revolving all these things, a prudential feeling began to steal over me. My first emotions had been those of pure melancholy and sincerest pity; but just in proportion as the forlornness of Bartleby grew and grew to my imagination, did that same melancholy merge into fear, that pity into repulsion. So true it is, and so terrible too, that up to a certain point the thought or sight of misery enlists our best affections; but, in certain special cases, beyond that point it does not. They err who would assert that invariably this is owing to the inherent selfishness of the human heart. It rather proceeds from a certain hopelessness of remedying excessive and organic ill. To a sensitive being, pity is not seldom pain. And when at last it is perceived that such pity cannot lead to effectual succor, common sense bids the soul rid of it. What I saw that morning persuaded me that the scrivener was the victim of innate and incurable disorder. I might give alms to his body; but his body did not pain him; it was his soul that suffered, and his soul I could not reach.",Human,Herman Melville,Original Novel,0.6116071428571429,0.6363636363636364,6.111111111111111,5,0,0,11.746875934230196
"I did not accomplish the purpose of going to Trinity Church that morning. Somehow, the things I had seen disqualified me for the time from church-going. I walked homeward, thinking what I would do with Bartleby. Finally, I resolved upon this;—I would put certain calm questions to him the next morning, touching his history, etc., and if he declined to answer them openly and unreservedly (and I supposed he would prefer not), then to give him a twenty dollar bill over and above whatever I might owe him, and tell him his services were no longer required; but that if in any other way I could assist him, I would be happy to do so, especially if he desired to return to his native place, wherever that might be, I would willingly help to defray the expenses. Moreover, if, after reaching home, he found himself at any time in want of aid, a letter from him would be sure of a reply.",Human,Herman Melville,Original Novel,0.6296296296296297,0.38095238095238093,5.6,2,0,1,12.130123456790127
"Again I sat ruminating what I should do. Mortified as I was at his behavior, and resolved as I had been to dismiss him when I entered my offices, nevertheless I strangely felt something superstitious knocking at my heart, and forbidding me to carry out my purpose, and denouncing me for a villain if I dared to breathe one bitter word against this forlornest of mankind. At last, familiarly drawing my chair behind his screen, I sat down and said: “Bartleby, never mind then about revealing your history; but let me entreat you, as a friend, to comply as far as may be with the usages of this office. Say now you will help to examine papers to-morrow or next day: in short, say now that in a day or two you will begin to be a little reasonable:—say so, Bartleby.”",Human,Herman Melville,Original Novel,0.6879432624113475,0.3333333333333333,6.5,1,0,1,15.062464539007092
"Somehow, of late I had got into the way of involuntarily using this word “prefer” upon all sorts of not exactly suitable occasions.

"As he opened the folding-door to retire, Nippers at his desk caught a glimpse of me, and asked whether I would prefer to have a certain paper copied on blue paper or white. He did not in the least roguishly accent the word prefer. It was plain that it involuntarily rolled from his tongue.

"I was touched. I said something in condolence with him. I hinted that of course he did wisely in abstaining from writing for a while; and urged him to embrace that opportunity of taking wholesome exercise in the open air. This, however, he did not do. A few days after this, my other clerks being absent, and being in a great hurry to dispatch certain letters by the mail, I thought that, having nothing else earthly to do, Bartleby would surely be less inflexible than usual, and carry these letters to the post-office.

"He remained as ever, a fixture in my chamber. Nay—if that were possible—he became still more of a fixture than before. What was to be done? He would do nothing in the office: why should he stay there? In plain fact, he had now become a millstone to me, not only useless as a necklace, but afflictive to bear. Yet I was sorry for him. I speak less than truth when I say that, on his own account, he occasioned me uneasiness. If he would but have named a single relative or friend, I would instantly have written, and urged their taking the poor fellow away to some convenient retreat. But he seemed alone, absolutely alone in the universe. A bit of wreck in the mid Atlantic. At length, necessities connected with my business tyrannized over all other considerations. Decently as I could, I told Bartleby that in six days’ time he must unconditionally leave the office. I warned him to take measures, in the interval, for procuring some other abode. I offered to assist him in this endeavor, if he himself would but take the first step towards a removal. “And when you finally quit me, Bartleby,” added I, “I shall see that you go not away entirely unprovided.

I shall not see you again; so good-bye to you. If hereafter in your new place of abode I can be of any service to you, do not fail to advise me by letter.

"As I walked home in a pensive mood, my vanity got the better of my pity. I could not but highly plume myself on my masterly management in getting rid of Bartleby. Masterly I call it, and such it must appear to any dispassionate thinker. The beauty of my procedure seemed to consist in its perfect quietness. There was no vulgar bullying, no bravado of any sort, no choleric hectoring, and striding to and fro across the apartment, jerking out vehement commands for Bartleby to bundle himself off with his beggarly traps. Nothing of the kind. Without loudly bidding Bartleby depart—as an inferior genius might have done—I _assumed_ the ground that depart he must; and upon that assumption built all I had to say. The more I thought over my procedure, the more I was charmed with it. Nevertheless, next morning, upon awakening, I had my doubts,—I had somehow slept off the fumes of vanity. One of the coolest and wisest hours a man has, is just after he awakes in the morning. My procedure seemed as sagacious as ever.—but only in theory. How it would prove in practice—there was the rub. It was truly a beautiful thought to have assumed Bartleby’s departure; but, after all, that assumption was simply my own, and none of Bartleby’s. The great point was, not whether I had assumed that he would quit me, but whether he would prefer so to do. He was more a man of preferences than assumptions.",Human,Herman Melville,Original Novel,0.5524193548387096,0.5,4.4,2,0,5,7.724552125506072
"After breakfast, I walked down town, arguing the probabilities _pro_ and _con_. One moment I thought it would prove a miserable failure, and Bartleby would be found all alive at my office as usual; the next moment it seemed certain that I should see his chair empty.

Yes, my procedure had worked to a charm; he indeed must be vanished. Yet a certain melancholy mixed with this: I was almost sorry for my brilliant success.

"“Not gone!” I murmured at last. But again obeying that wondrous ascendancy which the inscrutable scrivener had over me, and from which ascendancy, for all my chafing, I could not completely escape, I slowly went down stairs and out into the street, and while walking round the block, considered what I should next do in this unheard-of perplexity. Turn the man out by an actual thrusting I could not; to drive him away by calling him hard names would not do; calling in the police was an unpleasant idea; and yet, permit him to enjoy his cadaverous triumph over me,—this too I could not think of. What was to be done? or, if nothing could be done, was there any thing further that I could _assume_ in the matter? Yes, as before I had prospectively assumed that Bartleby would depart, so now I might retrospectively assume that departed he was. In the legitimate carrying out of this assumption, I might enter my office in a great hurry, and pretending not to see Bartleby at all, walk straight against him as if he were air. Such a proceeding would in a singular degree have the appearance of a home-thrust. It was hardly possible that Bartleby could withstand such an application of the doctrine of assumptions.

"I was now in such a state of nervous resentment that I thought it but prudent to check myself at present from further demonstrations. Bartleby and I were alone. I remembered the tragedy of the unfortunate Adams and the still more unfortunate Colt in the solitary office of the latter; and how poor Colt, being dreadfully incensed by Adams, and imprudently permitting himself to get wildly excited, was at unawares hurried into his fatal act—an act which certainly no man could possibly deplore more than the actor himself. Often it had occurred to me in my ponderings upon the subject, that had that altercation taken place in the public street, or at a private residence, it would not have terminated as it did. It was the circumstance of being alone in a solitary office, up stairs, of a building entirely unhallowed by humanizing domestic associations—an uncarpeted office, doubtless, of a dusty, haggard sort of appearance;—this it must have been, which greatly helped to enhance the irritable desperation of the hapless Colt.",Human,Herman Melville,Original Novel,0.6395348837209303,0.8518518518518519,5.833333333333333,2,0,3,17.414666666666665
"But when this old Adam of resentment rose in me and tempted me concerning Bartleby, I grappled him and threw him. How? Why, simply by recalling the divine injunction: “A new commandment give I unto you, that ye love one another.” Yes, this it was that saved me. Aside from higher considerations, charity often operates as a vastly wise and prudent principle—a great safeguard to its possessor. Men have committed murder for jealousy’s sake, and anger’s sake, and hatred’s sake, and selfishness’ sake, and spiritual pride’s sake; but no man that ever I heard of, ever committed a diabolical murder for sweet charity’s sake. Mere self-interest, then, if no better motive can be enlisted, should, especially with high-tempered men, prompt all beings to charity and philanthropy. At any rate, upon the occasion in question, I strove to drown my exasperated feelings towards the scrivener by benevolently construing his conduct.

"I endeavored also immediately to occupy myself, and at the same time to comfort my despondency. I tried to fancy that in the course of the morning, at such time as might prove agreeable to him, Bartleby, of his own free accord, would emerge from his hermitage, and take up some decided line of march in the direction of the door. But no. Half-past twelve o’clock came; Turkey began to glow in the face, overturn his inkstand, and become generally obstreperous; Nippers abated down into quietude and courtesy; Ginger Nut munched his noon apple; and Bartleby remained standing at his window in one of his profoundest dead-wall reveries.

"Some days now passed, during which, at leisure intervals I looked a little into “Edwards on the Will,” and “Priestly on Necessity.” Under the circumstances, those books induced a salutary feeling. Gradually I slid into the persuasion that these troubles of mine touching the scrivener, had been all predestinated from eternity, and Bartleby was billeted upon me for some mysterious purpose of an all-wise Providence, which it was not for a mere mortal like me to fathom. Yes, Bartleby, stay there behind your screen, thought I; I shall persecute you no more; you are harmless and noiseless as any of these old chairs; in short, I never feel so private as when I know you are here. At last I see it, I feel it; I penetrate to the predestinated purpose of my life. I am content. Others may have loftier parts to enact; but my mission in this world, Bartleby, is to furnish you with office-room for such period as you may see fit to remain.",Human,Herman Melville,Original Novel,0.6863905325443787,0.6,5.571428571428571,5,0,0,11.09632164242943
"I believe that this wise and blessed frame of mind would have continued with me, had it not been for the unsolicited and uncharitable remarks obtruded upon me by my professional friends who visited the rooms. But thus it often is, that the constant friction of illiberal minds wears out at last the best resolves of the more generous. Though to be sure, when I reflected upon it, it was not strange that people entering my office should be struck by the peculiar aspect of the unaccountable Bartleby, and so be tempted to throw out some sinister observations concerning him. Sometimes an attorney having business with me, and calling at my office and finding no one but the scrivener there, would undertake to obtain some sort of precise information from him touching my whereabouts; but without heeding his idle talk, Bartleby would remain standing immovable in the middle of the room. So after contemplating him in that position for a time, the attorney would depart, no wiser than he came.",Human,Herman Melville,Original Novel,0.6705882352941176,0.7307692307692307,6.8,1,0,0,15.786470588235293
"Also, when a Reference was going on, and the room full of lawyers and witnesses and business was driving fast; some deeply occupied legal gentleman present, seeing Bartleby wholly unemployed, would request him to run round to his (the legal gentleman’s) office and fetch some papers for him. Thereupon, Bartleby would tranquilly decline, and yet remain idle as before. Then the lawyer would give a great stare, and turn to me. And what could I say? At last I was made aware that all through the circle of my professional acquaintance, a whisper of wonder was running round, having reference to the strange creature I kept at my office. This worried me very much. And as the idea came upon me of his possibly turning out a long-lived man, and keep occupying my chambers, and denying my authority; and perplexing my visitors; and scandalizing my professional reputation; and casting a general gloom over the premises; keeping soul and body together to the last upon his savings (for doubtless he spent but half a dime a day), and in the end perhaps outlive me, and claim possession of my office by right of his perpetual occupancy: as all these dark anticipations crowded upon me more and more, and my friends continually intruded their relentless remarks upon the apparition in my room; a great change was wrought in me.

"Ere revolving any complicated project, however, adapted to this end, I first simply suggested to Bartleby the propriety of his permanent departure.

You will not thrust him, the poor, pale, passive mortal,—you will not thrust such a helpless creature out of your door? you will not dishonor yourself by such cruelty? No, I will not, I cannot do that. Rather would I let him live and die here, and then mason up his remains in the wall. What then will you do? For all your coaxing, he will not budge.

It is because he will _not_ be a vagrant, then, that you seek to count him _as_ a vagrant. That is too absurd. No visible means of support: there I have him. Wrong again: for indubitably he _does_ support himself, and that is the only unanswerable proof that any man can show of his possessing the means so to do. No more then.

Fearful then of being exposed in the papers (as one person present obscurely threatened) I considered the matter, and at length said, that if the lawyer would give me a confidential interview with the scrivener, in his (the lawyer’s) own room, I would that afternoon strive my best to rid them of the nuisance they complained of.",Human,Herman Melville,Original Novel,0.6608695652173913,0.5294117647058824,5.8,0,0,2,11.629456521739133

"I answered nothing; but effectually dodging every one by the suddenness and rapidity of my flight, rushed from the building, ran up Wall-street towards Broadway, and jumping into the first omnibus was soon removed from pursuit. As soon as tranquility returned I distinctly perceived that I had now done all that I possibly could, both in respect to the demands of the landlord and his tenants, and with regard to my own desire and sense of duty, to benefit Bartleby, and shield him from rude persecution. I now strove to be entirely care-free and quiescent; and my conscience justified me in the attempt; though indeed it was not so successful as I could have wished. So fearful was I of being again hunted out by the incensed landlord and his exasperated tenants, that, surrendering my business to Nippers, for a few days I drove about the upper part of the town and through the suburbs, in my rockaway; crossed over to Jersey City and Hoboken, and paid fugitive visits to Manhattanville and Astoria.

Moreover, since I knew more about him than any one else, he wished me to appear at that place, and make a suitable statement of the facts. These tidings had a conflicting effect upon me.

"The tension between the singular human spirit and the collective structure of society remains one of the most enduring themes in the literary and philosophical canon. At its core, this conflict arises from the inherent desire for autonomy clashing with the practical necessity of communal order. An individual seeks to define themselves through unique experiences, personal values, and private ambitions, yet they must navigate a world governed by shared norms and institutional expectations. Society, in its quest for stability and cohesion, often exerts a subtle but persistent pressure toward conformity, rewarding those who align with the majority and marginalizing those who deviate. This dynamic is not merely a struggle for power but a fundamental negotiation of identity. To live entirely for oneself is to risk isolation and the loss of the civilizational benefits that only a group can provide, while to live entirely for the collective is to risk the erasure of the self. The balance between these two forces defines the trajectory of a human life.",ai_generic,,Individual vs Society,0.6706586826347305,0.40476190476190477,6.714285714285714,0,0,0,15.618477331052183
"While the individual and society are often depicted as opposing forces, they exist in a state of profound and inescapable symbiosis. A society is not an abstract entity but a complex tapestry woven from the threads of countless individual lives, each contributing to the strength and pattern of the whole. Conversely, the individual is a product of their social environment, shaped by the language, traditions, and moral frameworks inherited from those who came before. Without the structure of the collective, the individual would lack the tools necessary to articulate their own existence or achieve complex goals that require cooperation. However, the health of a society depends entirely on the creative vitality and critical dissent of its members. When the collective stifles the individual, it stagnates, losing the capacity for innovation and self-correction. True progress occurs when the framework of the community is flexible enough to accommodate the idiosyncratic genius of the person, allowing for a mutual flourishing that benefits both the part and the whole.",ai_generic,,Individual vs Society,0.6566265060240963,0.4090909090909091,7.857142857142857,0,0,0,15.98709956709957
"Throughout history, the pendulum of priority has swung between the rights of the person and the needs of the state, reflecting changing perceptions of human nature. In many ancient cultures, the individual was viewed primarily as a functional component of a larger religious or political body, with their value derived from their service to the common good. The advent of Enlightenment thought shifted this perspective, placing the sovereign individual at the center of the moral universe and asserting that society exists to protect the inherent rights of its citizens. This transition birthed modern concepts of liberty and self-determination, yet it also introduced new anxieties regarding social fragmentation and the loss of communal purpose. In the contemporary era, the rise of digital connectivity has further complicated this relationship, creating global networks that offer unprecedented platforms for self-expression while simultaneously imposing new forms of surveillance and groupthink.

"The psychological dimension of the individual versus society is characterized by a dual yearning for belonging and for distinction. Humans are inherently social creatures, hardwired to seek the safety and validation of the tribe, yet we also possess a deep-seated need to be recognized as distinct entities with our own agency. This creates a perpetual internal friction; the comfort of the crowd provides a sense of security and shared meaning, but it can also feel like a cage that restricts the expansion of the soul. To stand apart from the group requires a degree of courage that risks social ostracization, a fate that many find more daunting than physical hardship. Yet, it is often in the moments of quiet rebellion or solitary reflection that the most profound human insights are discovered. The challenge of existence lies in finding a way to participate in the collective narrative without losing the thread of one’s own story, maintaining a sense of integrity while contributing to the broader human experience.",ai_generic,,Individual vs Society,0.688622754491018,0.4634146341463415,7.333333333333333,1,0,0,15.38795180722892
"The relationship between the individual and the collective is defined by a persistent, quiet friction that shapes the contours of human experience. Every person carries an internal landscape of desires, memories, and impulses that are entirely their own, yet they must navigate a world built upon shared rules and mutual expectations. Society functions as a necessary architecture, providing the safety and resources required for survival, but it often demands a degree of conformity that can stifle the singular spirit. This tension is not necessarily a sign of failure; rather, it is the fundamental engine of culture. When the private will aligns with the public good, there is a sense of harmonious progress, but when they diverge, the individual is forced to choose between the comfort of belonging and the integrity of their own convictions. This struggle to remain authentic while participating in the broader human story is a universal challenge, requiring a delicate balance between the need for personal autonomy and the inherent responsibilities of being part of a community.",ai_generic,,Individual vs Society,0.6705882352941176,0.45454545454545453,7.5,1,0,0,17.255294117647058
"Throughout history, the outlier has served as both a threat to social stability and the primary catalyst for its evolution. While the majority often finds security in the preservation of established norms, the individual who dares to question these structures introduces the possibility of change. This dynamic creates a cyclical process where the collective initially resists the deviant voice, only to eventually absorb its insights into a new, expanded consensus. The rebel, the artist, and the philosopher all occupy this precarious space on the periphery, challenging the inertia of the masses with the force of a singular vision. Without this constant pressure from the individual, society would risk stagnation, becoming a closed system incapable of correcting its own errors. However, the cost of such defiance is often high, as the group tends to protect its cohesion through various forms of exclusion or censure. The dialogue between the solitary mind and the collective will is thus a transformative force, ensuring that the structures of civilization remain responsive to the shifting realities of the human condition.",ai_generic,,Individual vs Society,0.6896551724137931,0.3877551020408163,7.285714285714286,0,0,0,16.07669950738916
"The human psyche is caught in a perpetual tug-of-war between the desire for absolute independence and the deep-seated need for social validation. To exist in total isolation is to lose the mirrors that reflect one’s identity, as much of who we are is defined in relation to others. Language, morality, and even the concept of the self are constructs born from social interaction. Yet, there is a profound danger in becoming too deeply embedded within the group, where the individual voice is drowned out by the roar of the crowd. In such states of total immersion, the capacity for critical thought can be surrendered to the comfort of the hive mind. The challenge of a conscious life is to find a middle ground where one can contribute to the welfare of the whole without sacrificing the essence of the self. We are social creatures who paradoxically require solitude to understand our place within the network. This duality suggests that the individual and society are not truly separate entities, but rather two sides of the same coin, each defining and sustaining the other.",ai_generic,,Individual vs Society,0.6324324324324324,0.43478260869565216,7.625,0,0,0,12.538543956043956
"In the modern era, the boundary between the private individual and the public sphere has become increasingly porous, altered by the pervasive influence of digital connectivity. Where once the self could retreat into a sanctuary of anonymity, the contemporary world demands a constant performance of identity for an invisible, global audience. This shift has transformed the nature of social pressure, making the gaze of the collective more immediate and unrelenting than ever before. The individual is now encouraged to curate their life as a series of broadcastable moments, often prioritizing the perception of the group over the reality of their own experience. While this connectivity offers unprecedented opportunities for finding like-minded communities, it also risks homogenizing thought through the rapid spread of consensus and the fear of public ostracization. The struggle for autonomy has moved from the physical town square to the digital landscape, where the individual must fight to maintain a sense of self that is not merely a reflection of algorithmic trends or collective approval.

However, this same framework can become a restrictive cage when personal inclinations diverge from the established path. The quest for authenticity requires a constant negotiation with the surrounding environment, as one seeks to carve out a private space within a public world.

"Entering into the social contract involves a fundamental trade-off that defines the modern human experience. To gain the protection and resources offered by a community, the individual must voluntarily relinquish certain absolute freedoms. This exchange is the cornerstone of civilization, allowing for the development of complex systems that no person could sustain alone. Yet, the cost of this security is often a subtle erosion of autonomy, as laws and social mores dictate the boundaries of acceptable behavior. The friction arises when the collective will imposes itself upon the private conscience, forcing a choice between compliance and dissent. While the group provides a safety net, it also exerts a gravitational pull toward the center, discouraging the radical departures that define true individuality. Balancing these competing interests is the central challenge of any organized society, requiring a constant recalibration of where the rights of the one end and the needs of the many begin.",ai_generic,,Individual vs Society,0.7320261437908496,0.38636363636363635,6.142857142857143,0,0,0,15.391729323308272
"History is frequently viewed as a grand narrative of collective movements, yet its most significant shifts often originate within the mind of a solitary figure. The individual serves as the primary engine of innovation, questioning the assumptions that a society takes for granted. When a person stands apart from the crowd, they provide a mirror in which the collective can see its own flaws and contradictions. This act of standing alone is inherently risky, as the group often reacts to deviation with suspicion or outright hostility. Nevertheless, it is through this confrontation that social structures evolve and adapt to new realities. The tension between the innovator and the establishment is not merely a conflict of interests but a necessary process of renewal. By challenging the prevailing consensus, the individual forces the society to justify its values or abandon them in favor of a more nuanced understanding of the human condition.",ai_generic,,Individual vs Society,0.6933333333333334,0.39473684210526316,6.142857142857143,0,0,0,14.16447619047619
"The human psyche is caught in a dual necessity for both profound solitude and meaningful connection. To be entirely subsumed by the group is to lose the essence of the self, resulting in a hollow conformity that stifles the spirit. Conversely, total isolation from the social fabric leads to a fragmentation of identity, as the self requires the reflection of others to achieve a sense of reality. This paradox defines the struggle of the individual within the broader community. We seek the warmth of the hearth and the security of the tribe, yet we also yearn for the quiet of the wilderness where our thoughts are entirely our own. The health of a society can often be measured by its ability to accommodate these opposing needs, providing a space for collective action without crushing the private interior life. Ultimately, the individual and society are not separate entities but two aspects of a single, complex phenomenon, each defining and sustaining the other in a continuous cycle of influence.",ai_generic,,Individual vs Society,0.6526946107784432,0.42857142857142855,6.142857142857143,0,0,0,14.629255774165955

This tension is the crucible in which character is forged, as the person must decide which aspects of their nature to reveal and which to submerge for the sake of communal harmony. To stand apart is to risk the coldness of alienation, yet to blend in entirely is to lose the unique spark that drives innovation and personal fulfillment. This delicate equilibrium ensures that the social fabric remains vibrant, woven from the threads of diverse perspectives that are nonetheless bound by a common purpose.

"The social contract serves as the invisible foundation of civilization, requiring the individual to trade a measure of absolute freedom for the collective benefits of order and security. This arrangement creates a complex landscape where personal ambition often collides with the broader requirements of the public good. Laws and ethical norms act as the boundaries of this interaction, seeking to harmonize the competing desires of millions into a functional reality. However, the individual frequently finds these constraints to be a source of friction, leading to a quiet internal dissent or an overt challenge to the status quo. The history of human progress is largely the history of this friction, as the conscience of the individual pushes against the inertia of established tradition.

The digital landscape has rendered the boundaries of the private sphere increasingly porous, inviting the constant gaze of the collective into the most intimate corners of personal life. This environment creates a unique pressure to perform, as the individual is often tempted to curate a version of themselves that aligns with the prevailing trends of social validation. As the distinction between personal thought and communal sentiment begins to blur, the challenge of maintaining an authentic identity becomes more pronounced. The individual risks becoming a mere node in a vast network, where the noise of the many can easily drown out the quiet reflections of the one.

While certain figures are remembered for their singular impact on the world, they are invariably the products of the cultural and historical contexts that shaped them. No person operates in a vacuum; every innovation and rebellion is informed by the language, values, and grievances of the surrounding society. This symbiotic relationship suggests that while the individual can act as a catalyst for change, it is the collective that provides the necessary material and energy for that change to take root. Society functions as both a nurturing environment and a restrictive cage, offering the tools for self-actualization while imposing the limits of what is considered acceptable or possible.

The struggle to maintain a unique internal landscape while adhering to the outward requirements of the group creates a persistent friction. This conflict is not necessarily destructive; rather, it is the crucible in which character is forged.

This resistance serves as a filtering mechanism, testing the validity and resilience of new concepts before they are integrated into the mainstream. The pioneer must possess the fortitude to stand apart from the crowd, enduring skepticism or marginalization in pursuit of a different truth.

"The assessment of a character’s moral standing often hinges on the tension between visible action and invisible intent. In literary analysis, a figure is rarely defined by a single deed, but rather by the cumulative weight of their choices as perceived through the lens of the narrator. When an observer attempts to pass judgment, they are frequently confronted with the discrepancy between what is done and why it is done. A virtuous act may be tainted by a selfish motive, just as a transgression might be born from a desperate necessity. This duality forces a re-evaluation of character, suggesting that morality is not a static trait but a fluid negotiation between the self and the world. As readers navigate these complexities, they must decide whether to prioritize the outcome of an action or the spirit in which it was performed, a process that reveals as much about the judge as it does about the subject.",ai_generic,,Moral Judgment and Interpretation of Character,0.6730769230769231,0.3076923076923077,6.5,0,0,0,13.974032258064518
"Contextual circumstances serve as the crucible in which moral judgment is refined and often complicated. A character existing in a vacuum might be easily categorized, yet the introduction of historical trauma or systemic pressure shifts the interpretive framework. When a narrative provides the background of a character’s upbringing or the immediate dangers they face, the observer’s initial condemnation often softens into a more nuanced understanding. This does not necessarily absolve the individual of their failings, but it contextualizes their behavior within a broader spectrum of human experience. The interpretation of character thus becomes an exercise in empathy, requiring one to weigh the influence of external forces against the exercise of free will. By examining the environment that shapes a person’s decisions, the reader moves beyond superficial labels of good and evil, recognizing that moral clarity is frequently obscured by the shadows of necessity and survival.",ai_generic,,Moral Judgment and Interpretation of Character,0.7241379310344828,0.3902439024390244,6.0,0,0,0,17.10948275862069
"The allure of the morally ambiguous character lies in their resistance to easy classification, challenging the traditional boundaries of hero and villain. Such figures often possess a blend of admirable qualities and profound flaws, creating a psychological depth that mirrors the inconsistencies of real life. When interpreting these characters, the reader is denied the comfort of a clear moral compass, forced instead to grapple with the contradictions inherent in human nature. A character might display immense loyalty in one instance and chilling cruelty in another, leaving the observer to reconcile these disparate traits into a cohesive identity. This interpretive struggle highlights the limitations of binary moral systems, suggesting that character is best understood as a spectrum of potentiality rather than a fixed point. In the absence of a definitive moral verdict, the focus shifts to the internal conflicts that drive the character, making the process of judgment an ongoing dialogue between the text and the reader’s own values.",ai_generic,,Moral Judgment and Interpretation of Character,0.6835443037974683,0.5,6.333333333333333,0,0,0,16.412911392405068
"Ultimately, the act of interpreting character is a dynamic process that evolves alongside the narrative, requiring a constant recalibration of moral judgment. As new information is revealed, the reader must be willing to discard previous assumptions and integrate fresh insights into their understanding of a figure’s moral core. This evolution reflects the reality that character is not a finished product but a continuous unfolding of being. The final judgment of a character is rarely a settled matter; it remains subject to the shifting perspectives of different readers and the cultural contexts in which the work is received. By engaging with the moral dilemmas presented in literature, individuals practice the delicate art of discernment, learning to navigate the complexities of human behavior with both rigor and compassion.

"The assessment of a character’s moral standing often hinges on the tension between visible actions and invisible intentions. When an observer witnesses a deed, they naturally project a set of values onto the actor, yet this interpretation is frequently a reflection of the observer’s own ethical framework rather than the actor’s internal reality. A single gesture of kindness might be viewed as genuine altruism or, conversely, as a calculated move for social gain. This ambiguity suggests that character is not a fixed essence but a narrative constructed through the interaction of behavior and perception. Because the human mind cannot directly access the private thoughts of another, moral judgment remains an exercise in speculative storytelling. We piece together fragments of history and conduct to form a coherent image, but this image is always subject to revision as new information emerges.

"Context serves as the primary lens through which moral judgment is filtered, often complicating the simple binary of good and evil. A character’s choices are rarely made in a vacuum; they are shaped by the pressures of necessity, the constraints of social standing, and the weight of past trauma. When interpreting character, one must consider whether an individual’s failings are a result of inherent malice or a desperate response to an unforgiving environment. A person who commits a transgression under duress is judged differently than one who acts out of pure self-interest, yet the line between these motivations is frequently blurred. This complexity forces the interpreter to weigh the influence of external circumstances against the exercise of personal agency. By acknowledging the role of context, moral judgment moves away from rigid condemnation and toward a more nuanced understanding of human frailty.

"The interpretation of character is further complicated by the fact that individuals are not static entities but are in a constant state of flux. A moral judgment rendered at one point in time may become obsolete as a character evolves through experience and reflection. This temporal dimension of character means that a single act, no matter how significant, cannot fully encapsulate the totality of a person’s moral identity. Redemption and regression are both possibilities that challenge the permanence of any ethical label. When we judge a character, we are often capturing a mere snapshot of a much longer and more complex trajectory. This fluidity requires a degree of humility from the interpreter, who must recognize that the person they are judging today may be fundamentally different tomorrow. The process of interpreting character thus becomes a longitudinal study rather than a momentary assessment. It demands an appreciation for the capacity for change, suggesting that the true measure of a person lies not in a single moment of crisis, but in the patterns of growth and decay that define a lifetime.",ai_generic,,Moral Judgment and Interpretation of Character,0.6555555555555556,0.3469387755102041,6.375,0,0,0,14.428987430167599
"Every act of moral judgment is inevitably colored by the personal values and biases of the individual performing the interpretation. The standards by which we measure the character of others are often rooted in our own cultural upbringing, philosophical leanings, and personal insecurities. Consequently, the same character may be hailed as a hero by one observer and dismissed as a villain by another, depending on which virtues the observer prioritizes. This subjectivity implies that the interpretation of character reveals as much about the judge as it does about the subject. When we condemn a specific trait in another, we are often affirming our own commitment to a contrary value. This reflexive nature of moral judgment creates a hall of mirrors where the boundaries between the observer and the observed become increasingly indistinct. To interpret character with any degree of fairness, one must first acknowledge the limitations of their own perspective. Only by recognizing the subjective nature of our moral lenses can we hope to approach a more balanced and empathetic understanding of the complex individuals we encounter.",ai_generic,,Moral Judgment and Interpretation of Character,0.6101694915254238,0.5,5.625,0,0,0,15.172083333333337

This isolation creates a vacuum that is quickly filled by a struggle between the desire for intimacy and the instinct for self-preservation. The conflict arises from the realization that while solitude offers a reprieve from the judgment of others, it intensifies the scrutiny of the self. Every perceived failure and every missed opportunity takes on a larger significance in the absence of distraction. The mind begins to loop through scenarios of what might have been, creating a friction that wears down the spirit. This internal battle is fought in the quietest of hours, where the absence of outside voices makes the internal dialogue deafening, forcing a confrontation with the very aspects of the self that the withdrawal was intended to hide.",ai_generic,,"Isolation, Withdrawal, and Inner Conflict",0.6646341463414634,0.25,7.428571428571429,1,0,0,13.688974583698513
"The landscape of isolation is marked by a peculiar tension between the comfort of the known and the terror of the unseen. When a person withdraws from the world, they often believe they are moving toward a more authentic version of themselves. However, the lack of social mirrors can lead to a fragmented sense of identity. Without the feedback of peers or the structure of daily routine, the internal world becomes a theater of conflicting impulses. One part of the psyche may crave the warmth of human contact, while another part fears the vulnerability that such contact requires. This inner conflict manifests as a restless energy that finds no outlet in the stillness of a secluded life. The individual becomes a spectator to their own mental processes, watching as thoughts collide and dissipate without resolution. The isolation that was meant to be a sanctuary transforms into a crucible, testing the limits of one's mental endurance and forcing a reckoning with the inherent contradictions of the human condition.",ai_generic,,"Isolation, Withdrawal, and Inner Conflict",0.6526946107784432,0.41304347826086957,6.125,0,0,0,12.26502245508982
"There is a profound paradox in the act of seeking solitude to resolve internal strife. While the removal of external stimuli can clarify one's thoughts, it also removes the buffers that typically soften the impact of one's own flaws. In the depths of withdrawal, the individual is forced to face the duality of their nature without the possibility of escape. This creates a state of perpetual inner conflict, where the need for self-acceptance battles against the drive for self-improvement. The silence of isolation becomes a mirror, reflecting not just the surface of the personality, but the deeper, more uncomfortable truths that lie beneath. Every choice to remain isolated is a choice to engage in this internal struggle, a commitment to a private war where there are no victors, only survivors. The conflict is not with the world, but with the shadows that the world usually obscures. Ultimately, the journey into isolation is a journey into the heart of one's own complexity, where the only way out is through the difficult process of reconciling these opposing forces.",ai_generic,,"Isolation, Withdrawal, and Inner Conflict",0.6067415730337079,0.2641509433962264,7.75,0,0,0,12.768409090909092
"The door closes, and the world outside becomes a distant murmur. Withdrawal is often a quiet process, a gradual receding from the social tide that once felt essential. In the stillness of a room, the individual begins to confront the echoes of their own thoughts, which were previously drowned out by the noise of interaction. This isolation is not merely a lack of company but a deliberate turning inward, where the boundaries of the self are tested against the void of solitude. The silence acts as a mirror, reflecting the fragmented pieces of a personality that has spent too long performing for others. As the external world fades, the internal landscape sharpens, revealing the first tremors of a conflict that has been brewing beneath the surface.

"Within the confines of self-imposed exile, a silent battle rages between the longing for connection and the instinct for self-preservation. This inner conflict manifests as a persistent tension, a tug-of-war between the comfort of the known and the terrifying possibility of being seen. To withdraw is to seek safety, yet the very walls built to protect the spirit eventually begin to feel like a cage. The mind becomes a courtroom where every past interaction is scrutinized, and every perceived failure is amplified by the lack of external perspective. One part of the soul yearns to reach out, to bridge the widening gap between the self and the collective, while another part recoils, fearing the vulnerability that comes with exposure.

"As isolation deepens, the perception of time begins to warp, losing its linear progression and dissolving into a series of repetitive moments. The external markers of days and hours lose their significance, replaced by the rhythmic pulse of internal rumination. In this state of withdrawal, the distinction between memory and imagination blurs, leading to a heightened sense of disorientation. The inner conflict takes on a more abstract form, as the individual struggles to reconcile their idealized version of the world with the stark reality of their current state. Every thought becomes a labyrinth, and every path leads back to the same unresolved questions of identity and purpose. The lack of social feedback allows the ego to expand and contract in unpredictable ways, creating a psychological landscape that is both vast and claustrophobic.

"The resolution of inner conflict rarely comes through the simple act of re-emerging into the world; rather, it requires a slow and painful integration of the lessons learned in solitude. Withdrawal serves as a crucible, a place where the dross of social expectation is burned away to reveal the core of the individual. However, the danger remains that the isolation will become a permanent state, a sanctuary that has turned into a tomb. The struggle to balance the need for autonomy with the necessity of community is a fundamental human challenge that is only amplified by the experience of being alone. Even when the door is finally opened, the echoes of the internal struggle remain, a quiet reminder of the fragility of the human psyche. The journey back from the depths of isolation is marked by a newfound awareness of the delicate thread that connects the inner life to the outer world, a thread that is easily frayed but essential for the maintenance of a coherent sense of self.",ai_generic,,"Isolation, Withdrawal, and Inner Conflict",0.611764705882353,0.42857142857142855,9.166666666666666,1,0,0,14.735828402366867
"When assessing the moral fiber of a literary figure, the observer often finds themselves caught between the character’s stated intentions and the tangible consequences of their actions. This discrepancy creates a fertile ground for interpretation, as a single gesture may be viewed as either a noble sacrifice or a calculated manipulation depending on the reader’s vantage point. We tend to project our own ethical frameworks onto these fictional personas, seeking a consistency that rarely exists in human nature. A character who commits a transgression for a perceived greater good challenges the simplicity of binary labels, forcing a reconsideration of what constitutes virtue. The process of judgment is thus rarely a final verdict but rather a continuous negotiation between the text’s evidence and the reader’s intuition. By navigating these complexities, one begins to understand that character is not a fixed essence but a fluid construct shaped by the interplay of choice, circumstance, and the subjective eye of the beholder.",ai_generic,,Moral Judgment and Interpretation of Character,0.7151898734177216,0.38636363636363635,8.0,0,0,0,16.412911392405068
"The allure of complex narratives often lies in the deliberate ambiguity of their protagonists, where moral clarity is sacrificed for psychological realism. When an author refuses to provide a clear ethical compass, the burden of interpretation shifts entirely to the audience, transforming the act of reading into a series of moral evaluations. This ambiguity serves as a mirror, reflecting the reader’s own biases and values back at them through their reaction to a character’s flaws. We might find ourselves sympathizing with a villain or questioning the motives of a traditional hero, revealing the fragility of our preconceived notions of right and wrong. Such narratives suggest that character is best understood not through isolated deeds, but through the internal struggles that precede them. In this light, moral judgment becomes an exercise in empathy, requiring us to look beyond the surface of behavior to find the underlying humanity that informs even the most questionable decisions.",ai_generic,,Moral Judgment and Interpretation of Character,0.6993464052287581,0.38095238095238093,7.333333333333333,0,0,0,16.25826797385621
"Interpretation of character is inextricably linked to the cultural and temporal context in which a work is received, as the virtues of one era may become the vices of another. A figure celebrated for their unwavering stoicism and adherence to duty in a classical setting might be perceived as cold or emotionally repressed by a modern audience. This shift highlights the evolutionary nature of moral judgment, reminding us that our standards for character are rarely universal or timeless. As societal values fluctuate, so too does the lens through which we view the motivations and justifications of those in literature. A character’s struggle against the constraints of their time can evoke either admiration for their rebellion or condemnation for their perceived recklessness, depending on the prevailing ethos of the reader’s world. Consequently, the act of judging a character is as much a reflection of the present moment as it is an analysis of the past, illustrating the dynamic relationship between literature and the shifting sands of human ethics.",ai_generic,,Moral Judgment and Interpretation of Character,0.6646706586826348,0.3409090909090909,6.5,0,0,0,16.533263473053896
"Ultimately, the moral judgment we pass upon a character reveals as much about the interpreter as it does about the subject of the critique. To label a character as courageous, cowardly, or deceitful is to invoke a personal standard of conduct that defines our own worldview. This reflexive quality of interpretation means that no two readers will ever perceive a character in exactly the same light, as each brings a unique history of experiences and beliefs to the text. The nuances of a character’s development provide a canvas upon which we paint our own moral aspirations and fears, turning the literary experience into a deeply personal dialogue. When we grapple with the contradictions of a complex figure, we are essentially practicing the art of human understanding, learning to tolerate the inconsistencies that define the human condition. In the end, the interpretation of character serves as a vital bridge between the abstract principles of morality and the messy, lived reality of individual existence.",ai_generic,,Moral Judgment and Interpretation of Character,0.6296296296296297,0.4634146341463415,5.833333333333333,0,0,0,16.500493827160494
"When assessing the moral fiber of a literary figure, the observer is often caught between the clarity of an action and the opacity of its underlying motive. We tend to assign virtue or vice based on the tangible fallout of a character’s choices, yet the internal architecture of their reasoning remains a labyrinth of conflicting impulses. A character may commit a transgression out of a desperate necessity that the reader can intellectually grasp, yet the emotional weight of the deed often triggers an instinctive condemnation. This friction suggests that moral judgment is rarely a static calculation; it is a fluid negotiation between what is done and why it is done. As we peel back the layers of a protagonist’s history, the initial simplicity of their goodness or wickedness frequently dissolves into a complex spectrum of human frailty.

"The lens through which a character is presented dictates the boundaries of the reader’s moral empathy. An omniscient narrator might provide the psychological context necessary to forgive a character’s failings, whereas a detached or biased perspective can render the same actions inexcusable. This structural manipulation highlights the subjective nature of interpretation, as the proximity to a character’s thoughts often softens the harshness of a moral verdict. When we are privy to the silent justifications and the private agonies of a flawed individual, the impulse to categorize them as a villain is frequently tempered by a recognition of shared vulnerability. Conversely, a character viewed only through the eyes of their victims appears monolithic in their cruelty, stripped of the nuance that might otherwise complicate a moral assessment. Thus, the act of judging a character is inextricably linked to the narrative framework, which selectively reveals or conceals the elements required for a comprehensive ethical evaluation.",ai_generic,,Moral Judgment and Interpretation of Character,0.6666666666666666,0.5263157894736842,7.0,0,0,0,16.875261437908495
"Literary ambiguity serves as a crucible for moral judgment, forcing the reader to navigate a landscape where traditional markers of right and wrong are intentionally obscured. Characters who inhabit this gray space challenge the comfort of binary classifications, demanding a more sophisticated level of interpretation that accounts for contradiction and paradox. In these instances, the reader becomes an active participant in the creation of the character’s moral identity, filling in the gaps left by the author with their own values and experiences. A character’s silence or an unresolved conflict can provoke a wide range of interpretations, each revealing a different facet of the human condition. This lack of definitive closure prevents the reader from reaching a final, comfortable verdict, ensuring that the character remains a living, breathing entity within the mind.

"The interpretation of character is rarely a fixed event, but rather a process that evolves alongside the narrative’s progression. An initial impression of moral rectitude may be slowly eroded by a series of subtle compromises, just as a character introduced in a state of disgrace might find a path toward redemption. This temporal dimension of judgment requires the observer to remain flexible, constantly re-evaluating their stance as new information comes to light. The tension between a character’s past actions and their present potential creates a dynamic moral landscape where the possibility of change is always present. However, the weight of previous transgressions often lingers, casting a shadow over even the most sincere efforts at transformation. This struggle between the permanence of the past and the fluidity of the future is central to the interpretation of character, as it forces us to decide whether a person is the sum of their mistakes or the potential of their aspirations.",ai_generic,,Moral Judgment and Interpretation of Character,0.6518987341772152,0.3333333333333333,6.0,0,0,0,15.65958598726115
"When assessing the moral fiber of an individual, the observer often encounters a profound disconnect between visible action and internal motivation. A character may perform a deed that appears altruistic on the surface, yet the underlying impulse might be rooted in vanity or fear. Conversely, a seemingly callous act might be the result of a desperate necessity that remains hidden from the public eye. This tension forces the interpreter to navigate a labyrinth of ambiguity, where the truth of a person’s nature is rarely found in a single event. Instead, moral judgment becomes a cumulative process, requiring a careful weighing of consistent patterns against isolated lapses. The difficulty lies in the fact that we can never truly inhabit another’s consciousness; we are left to piece together a mosaic of character from fragments of behavior, often projecting our own values onto the gaps. Consequently, the interpretation of character is less a definitive verdict and more an ongoing dialogue between the observer’s expectations and the subject’s lived reality.",ai_generic,,Moral Judgment and Interpretation of Character,0.6987951807228916,0.391304347826087,6.857142857142857,1,0,0,15.765800344234083
"The environment in which a character operates serves as the essential crucible for moral evaluation. It is easy to condemn a choice when it is viewed in a vacuum, stripped of the pressures and historical burdens that shaped it. However, a more nuanced interpretation recognizes that morality is often a response to circumstance rather than a static set of principles. A character who exhibits ruthlessness in a landscape of scarcity might be judged differently than one who acts with cruelty in a position of absolute security. By examining the external forces—social expectations, systemic injustices, or personal trauma—that act upon an individual, the interpreter gains a clearer understanding of the stakes involved in every decision. This contextual approach does not necessarily absolve the character of their failings, but it provides the necessary depth to transform a flat caricature of virtue or vice into a complex human portrait. Understanding the motivations behind an action is fundamental to any serious attempt at moral judgment, as it reveals the limits of human agency.",ai_generic,,Moral Judgment and Interpretation of Character,0.6900584795321637,0.4772727272727273,6.285714285714286,0,0,2,15.889619611158071
"Virtue and vice are frequently two sides of the same coin, and the interpretation of character often depends on which side is currently catching the light. A trait such as unwavering loyalty can be seen as a profound moral strength in one setting, yet in another, it may manifest as a dangerous blindness to the faults of a superior. Similarly, ambition can be the engine of progress or the catalyst for moral decay. The interpreter must therefore grapple with the inherent instability of these qualities, recognizing that a character’s greatest asset is often inextricably linked to their most significant flaw. This duality suggests that moral judgment is not merely about identifying specific traits, but about observing how those traits interact with the world. When a character’s strengths lead to their downfall, or their weaknesses inadvertently produce a positive outcome, the traditional boundaries of morality become blurred. This complexity challenges the observer to move beyond simplistic labels and instead appreciate the intricate, often contradictory, architecture of the human spirit.",ai_generic,,Moral Judgment and Interpretation of Character,0.7023809523809523,0.4634146341463415,5.714285714285714,0,0,0,15.33309523809524
"Ultimately, the act of moral judgment reveals as much about the interpreter as it does about the character being scrutinized. Every observer brings a unique set of biases, cultural norms, and personal experiences to the task of evaluation, which inevitably colors their perception of right and wrong. What one person views as a courageous stand, another might interpret as reckless obstinacy. This subjectivity means that the moral truth of a character is often a collaborative construction between the subject and the witness. In literature and life alike, we tend to sympathize with characters whose struggles mirror our own, while we are quicker to judge those whose motivations feel alien or threatening. By acknowledging this inherent partiality, the interpreter can begin to approach character with a degree of humility. The goal of moral judgment, then, is not to achieve a final, objective ranking of worth, but to engage in a process of reflection that deepens our understanding of the human condition and the diverse ways in which individuals navigate the ethical challenges of existence.",ai_generic,,Moral Judgment and Interpretation of Character,0.6763005780346821,0.4444444444444444,6.571428571428571,0,0,0,15.465912469033857

To have a particular inclination that does not align with the general consensus is to invite a species of polite persecution, conducted entirely through the lifting of eyebrows and the strategic use of silence. One must learn to fold one's spirit into the prescribed dimensions of the drawing-room, for any protrusion of genuine feeling is regarded as a breach of decorum. It is, after all, far more comfortable for the collective if the individual remains a predictable cipher, contributing to the harmony of the whole without the tiresome necessity of being understood.

It is a remarkable feature of human nature that those who have the least occupation are always the most industriously employed in regulating the conduct of others. Should an individual deviate by a hair’s breadth from the path of established custom, it is not merely a personal choice, but a public affront. The society in which one moves is less a support and more a mirror, though one that is frequently warped by the prejudices of the observer.

A person of spirit may feel the injustice of such an arrangement, yet they are soon reminded that to follow one’s own heart is often synonymous with following one’s own ruin. Society demands a certain performance of duty, which is frequently nothing more than the gratification of other people’s vanity. To be ""sensible"" is to stifle the very qualities that make one unique, and to be ""amiable"" is to agree with everyone else’s errors.

We are all, in some measure, the creatures of our education and our surroundings, and the individual who fancies himself entirely free is usually the one most blinded by his own conceit. True independence is a rare and dangerous commodity, for it requires a courage that few possess: the courage to be genuinely indifferent to the praise or blame of those who have no right to judge.

"To stand apart from the multitude is a luxury that few can afford and even fewer can enjoy without the accompaniment of a persistent, if polite, censure. When a person chooses to consult their own judgment rather than the prevailing whims of the season, they are immediately suspected of a most dangerous eccentricity. It is not that the world objects to independence in principle; rather, it finds the practice of it most inconvenient when it disrupts the established patterns of gossip and matchmaking. A person of independent thoughts is a trial to their relations, who would much prefer they be guided by the collective experience of their elders. The society of a small town is particularly adept at monitoring these deviations, offering a wealth of unsolicited advice under the guise of neighborly affection. One is reminded, through a series of meaningful glances and pointed remarks, that the individual is but a single thread in a vast tapestry, and any attempt to pull away threatens the integrity of the entire design—or, at the very least, the peace of the next card party.",ai_styled,Jane Austen,Individual vs Society,0.6483516483516484,0.5,7.0,1,0,1,16.058977900552488
"It must be admitted that the individual, however much they may rail against the constraints of the world, is rarely content to exist entirely without its notice. There is a peculiar vanity in being misunderstood, which requires an audience to witness the misunderstanding if it is to be truly savored. Society provides the very stage upon which the individual performs their acts of defiance, and without the watchful eyes of one’s peers, the most spirited independence would lose much of its luster. We are all, in some measure, creatures of our environment, seeking the validation of the very circles we profess to despise. The tension between the desire for solitude and the necessity of connection creates a most diverting spectacle for the keen observer. While we may lament the intrusions of our neighbors and the tiresome demands of social duty, we are equally loath to find ourselves forgotten by the world. It is a delicate balance to maintain: to cherish one’s private virtues while ensuring they are displayed in a light that the public cannot fail to admire, however much they may pretend to disapprove.",ai_styled,Jane Austen,Individual vs Society,0.6236559139784946,0.325,7.0,0,0,0,14.426332046332046
"It is a truth frequently observed that a person of singular mind must often find themselves at odds with the collective wisdom of their neighbors. To possess a sentiment not shared by the general assembly is often regarded as a defect of character rather than a distinction of intellect. One must learn to drape their private inclinations in the respectable garb of public expectation, lest they be thought eccentric or, worse, indifferent to the comforts of established custom. The world is remarkably fond of prescribing the exact measure of happiness one ought to feel, and any deviation from this prescribed dose is met with a concern that is as stifling as it is insincere. Thus, the individual learns the art of the polite mask, ensuring that their most cherished convictions are whispered only in the privacy of their own reflections, while their public countenance remains as unruffled as a summer pond, reflecting everything but revealing nothing of the depths beneath.",ai_styled,Jane Austen,Individual vs Society,0.68125,0.5454545454545454,7.8,0,0,0,15.917500000000004
"The collective eye of a small community is a formidable instrument, capable of detecting the slightest tremor in the social fabric with the precision of a jeweler examining a flawed stone. When an individual dares to prioritize their own discernment over the established prejudices of the many, they are soon made to feel the weight of a thousand silent censures. It is a curious phenomenon that those who have the least to occupy their own minds are invariably the most diligent in regulating the affairs of others. A single act of independence is often treated as a declaration of war against the very foundations of civility. One is expected to move in harmony with the general dance, regardless of whether the music suits their particular temperament. To step out of time is not merely a personal choice; it is viewed as a direct affront to the dancers who remain, who find in another’s liberty a most distressing reminder of their own voluntary chains.",ai_styled,Jane Austen,Individual vs Society,0.6380368098159509,0.6764705882352942,7.333333333333333,1,0,0,14.840582822085896
"There exists a delicate balance between the dictates of one’s own conscience and the formidable requirements of one’s station. A person of true sensibility may find that their heart speaks a language entirely foreign to the dialect of the drawing-room. While society demands a certain uniformity of opinion—preferring the safe, well-trodden paths of tradition—the restless spirit often yearns for a landscape of its own making. It is a trial of no small magnitude to remain civil when one’s most profound aspirations are dismissed as mere fancies by those who value a well-appointed carriage above a well-cultivated mind. The struggle is not always one of open rebellion, but rather a quiet, persistent effort to preserve a corner of the soul from the encroaching demands of a world that prizes appearance over substance. To be oneself in a world so determined to make one like everyone else requires a fortitude that is rarely recognized and even more rarely applauded by the multitude.",ai_styled,Jane Austen,Individual vs Society,0.6927710843373494,0.47368421052631576,9.333333333333334,0,0,2,14.501250000000002
"In the end, the individual and society must reach a sort of uneasy truce, a compromise where neither is entirely satisfied but both are sufficiently appeased. It is the way of the world that the most ardent spirits are eventually tempered by the cooling influence of general opinion, just as the most rigid social structures must occasionally bend to accommodate a particularly stubborn personality. One learns that to live entirely for oneself is a lonely endeavor, yet to live entirely for others is a form of slow erasure. The truly wise person navigates this labyrinth with a mixture of outward compliance and inward reservation, granting the world its due of bows and pleasantries while keeping the treasury of their thoughts under lock and key. It is a performance of great complexity, requiring a steady hand and a keen eye for the absurdities of human nature, which are never more apparent than when a single soul attempts to stand upright amidst a crowd of leaning shadows.",ai_styled,Jane Austen,Individual vs Society,0.6848484848484848,0.48717948717948717,8.2,0,0,0,16.94666666666667
"It is a truth universally acknowledged—though perhaps less universally enjoyed—that a person of any spirit must eventually find their edges softened by the relentless friction of polite company. To possess a mind of one’s own is a luxury that many profess to admire, yet few are willing to tolerate in a neighbor. Society, with its intricate web of expectations and its formidable arsenal of raised eyebrows, demands a certain uniformity of sentiment that can be quite exhausting to the solitary soul. One must learn to speak in the approved cadences, to laugh at the prescribed jests, and to suppress any inclination toward original thought that might disturb the tranquil surface of a dinner party. While the individual may secretly cherish a private garden of unconventional opinions, they soon discover that to flourish in the world, they must present a hedge as neatly trimmed as any other. It is, after all, far more comfortable to be thought dull and agreeable than to be celebrated for a brilliance that makes one’s acquaintances feel their own deficiencies too keenly.",ai_styled,Jane Austen,Individual vs Society,0.6741573033707865,0.6363636363636364,8.0,0,0,2,15.829545454545457
"The struggle between a private inclination and the collective wisdom of one’s circle is a drama performed daily, though often without the benefit of an audience. When a person’s heart suggests a path that the neighborhood deems imprudent, the resulting discord is felt more sharply than any physical ailment. Society, in its infinite benevolence, is always prepared to offer advice on matters it does not understand, guided by the principle that what is best for the many must surely be tolerable for the one. To defy such a consensus requires a fortitude that is frequently mistaken for obstinacy, or worse, a lack of proper breeding. One is expected to sacrifice personal happiness upon the altar of general convenience, comforted by the knowledge that one’s misery is at least conducted with the utmost propriety. It is a curious feature of human nature that we are never so concerned with the virtue of our friends as when their choices threaten to disrupt the established order of our own small world.",ai_styled,Jane Austen,Individual vs Society,0.7083333333333334,0.5405405405405406,7.0,0,0,0,15.066904761904762

A single deviation from the expected path—a word too bold, a silence too long—is seized upon with a zeal that would be admirable if it were applied to any useful purpose. In the drawing-rooms and along the shaded walks, the individual is dissected with a precision that leaves very little of the original person intact. It is not enough to be good; one must be seen to be good in precisely the manner that the current fashion dictates. The irony, of course, remains that those most eager to enforce the rules of conduct are often the ones who find the greatest pleasure in observing their breach.

"Despite the many grievances one may harbor against the intrusions of the world, it must be admitted that a total independence is a cold and lonely prospect. The very person who rails against the absurdity of social conventions is often the first to seek the warmth of a well-lit parlor when the evening turns chill. We are bound to one another by a thousand invisible threads, some of which chafe, while others provide a necessary support. To live entirely for oneself is to risk a narrowness of vision that is quite as stifling as the most rigid etiquette. Society, for all its follies and its insistence on the trivial, provides the stage upon which our virtues may be exercised and our wit displayed. Without the foil of our fellow creatures, our best qualities would wither for lack of use, and our worst would grow unchecked by the salutary fear of being laughed at.

"It is a curious feature of human society that those with the least amount of self-knowledge are often the most eager to pronounce judgment upon the souls of their neighbors. A single afternoon’s acquaintance, conducted over the rim of a teacup or amidst the bustle of a crowded assembly, is frequently deemed sufficient evidence to categorize a gentleman’s integrity or a lady’s temper. We pride ourselves on a discernment that is, in truth, little more than the reflection of our own prejudices. To find a neighbor wanting in some minor point of etiquette is, for many, a delightful confirmation of their own superior breeding. Thus, character is not so much studied as it is invented, shaped by the observer’s need for a convenient narrative. We mistake a pleasing countenance for a virtuous heart, and a reserved manner for a deficiency of intellect, rarely pausing to consider that the map we draw of another’s mind may bear no resemblance to the territory itself.",ai_styled,Jane Austen,Moral Judgment and Interpretation of Character,0.6871165644171779,0.4634146341463415,7.333333333333333,0,0,0,14.60666666666667

His arrogance is interpreted as noble dignity, and his indifference to the sufferings of others is viewed as a necessary consequence of his high station. Conversely, the individual of modest means finds his every hesitation scrutinized and his smallest errors magnified into grave defects of character. It is a melancholy truth that society is far more willing to forgive a vice that is gilded than a virtue that is poorly dressed. We allow the glitter of prosperity to blind us to the poverty of the spirit, and in doing so, we transform the act of moral judgment into a mere exercise in sycophancy.

A person may act with the strictest propriety in public while harboring a spirit of profound discontent, or they may possess a bluntness of speech that masks a most tender and generous disposition. Our judgments are too often based upon the outward performance of social duties rather than the inward motives that prompt them. We censure the man who fails to smile at the appropriate interval, yet we applaud the hypocrite whose manners are polished to a high shine.

This inclination toward uncharitable interpretation is often disguised as a zeal for truth, though it owes more to vanity than to any genuine concern for righteousness. We weigh the actions of our friends in scales that are perpetually tilted by our own insecurities, and we are never so eloquent as when we are describing the failings of those we profess to admire.

It is a truth often observed, though seldom admitted, that we interpret the failings of the wealthy as mere lapses of judgment, while the errors of the poor are scrutinized as fundamental defects of character.

We are too easily satisfied by the outward show of decorum, forgetting that the most rigorous adherence to social forms may coexist with a total absence of Christian charity.

"True character is seldom found in the theater of public life, where the mask of civility is worn with such practiced ease that it becomes indistinguishable from the face beneath. A person may be celebrated in every assembly for their wit and charm, yet remain a source of constant misery to those within their own domestic circle. It is in the small, unobserved moments—the treatment of a dependent, the response to a trivial disappointment, or the endurance of a tedious relation—that the genuine fiber of the soul is tested. Society, however, is content to judge by the surface, applauding the performance of virtue while the reality of it is neglected. We are so enamored with the appearance of goodness that we often fail to notice its absence, provided the breach of decorum is not so loud as to disturb our own comfort. Thus, many a reputation is built upon the fragile foundation of public affectation, while the silent virtues of the truly humble remain unrecorded and unpraised by a world that values glitter over gold.",ai_styled,Jane Austen,Moral Judgment and Interpretation of Character,0.655367231638418,0.5365853658536586,6.833333333333333,0,0,2,15.204428571428572
"There is a certain stubbornness in the human mind which makes it far more agreeable to persist in an error than to admit to a mistaken impression. Once we have decided that a particular individual is either a paragon of rectitude or a vessel of folly, we become remarkably blind to any evidence that might suggest the contrary. Every subsequent action of theirs is filtered through the lens of our initial prejudice, so that their virtues are diminished and their faults are magnified to suit our established narrative. To change one’s opinion of another’s character requires a degree of candor and humility that few are willing to exercise, for it involves the painful acknowledgment that our own discernment was flawed. We prefer the comfort of a settled judgment to the uncertainty of a shifting truth, and would rather see a neighbor suffer under a false reputation than endure the mortification of being proven wrong. In this manner, our interpretations of character become less a search for truth than a defense of our own supposed sagacity.",ai_styled,Jane Austen,Moral Judgment and Interpretation of Character,0.6514285714285715,0.42105263157894735,6.833333333333333,0,0,0,15.743857142857145
"The world is seldom satisfied with a person who prefers the company of their own thoughts to the clamour of a crowded drawing-room. To withdraw from the gaze of one’s neighbours is frequently interpreted as a mark of either profound melancholy or insufferable pride, for society cannot conceive of a mind sufficiently furnished to entertain itself. Yet, there is a particular species of isolation that arises not from a lack of invitations, but from the exhausting necessity of maintaining a countenance of perpetual cheerfulness. When the heart is at variance with the tongue, the most crowded assembly becomes a desert of insincerity. One finds that the effort to appear perfectly agreeable, while the spirit is engaged in a private skirmish of doubt, is a tax upon the constitution that few are willing to pay indefinitely. Thus, the sanctuary of one’s dressing-room is sought, not out of a distaste for humanity, but from a desperate need to reconcile the person one is expected to be with the person one truly feels oneself to become in the silence of reflection.",ai_styled,Jane Austen,"Isolation, Withdrawal, and Inner Conflict",0.6022099447513812,0.35714285714285715,7.833333333333333,0,0,0,15.5361797752809
"There is a peculiar misery in possessing a mind that is perpetually at war with its own inclinations. A lady may sit quite still, her needlework progressing with admirable regularity, while within her breast a tempest of indecision rages with a violence that would astonish her companions. This inner conflict, though invisible to the casual observer, demands a withdrawal of the spirit that no amount of physical presence can remedy. To be told that one’s duty is clear is often the least helpful of consolations when that duty requires the sacrifice of one’s most cherished hopes. In such instances, isolation becomes a necessary fortification. One retreats into a fortress of silence, not to brood upon injuries, but to prevent the betrayal of a trembling lip or an unbidden tear. It is a singular irony of our civilized state that the more one feels, the more one must appear to feel nothing at all, until the very walls of the house seem to offer more sympathy than the most well-meaning of relations.",ai_styled,Jane Austen,"Isolation, Withdrawal, and Inner Conflict",0.6802325581395349,0.46511627906976744,6.714285714285714,0,0,0,13.465797827903092
"It is often remarked that solitude is the nurse of wisdom, yet it is more frequently the refuge of those who find the world’s demands upon their temper to be quite beyond their current means. To withdraw from the social circle is a privilege often mistaken for a penance. When the mind is occupied by a conflict of the affections, the most spirited country dance or the most elegant dinner party serves only to heighten the sense of one’s own estrangement. There is a certain irony in the fact that we are never so conscious of our isolation as when we are surrounded by those who profess to know us best. The struggle to align one’s outward conduct with a heart that is fundamentally unsettled is a labour of the highest order. Consequently, the choice to remain at home, ostensibly for the sake of a slight headache or a pressing correspondence, is often a strategic retreat. It allows for the restoration of that internal equilibrium which is so easily disturbed by the thoughtless remarks of the well-intentioned and the tedious observations of the dull.",ai_styled,Jane Austen,"Isolation, Withdrawal, and Inner Conflict",0.6216216216216216,0.38461538461538464,7.571428571428571,0,0,0,12.810341614906836
"To be at odds with oneself is a condition that no amount of external prosperity can alleviate. A person may be blessed with every advantage of fortune and connection, yet remain a prisoner to a divided will. This internal discord necessitates a degree of withdrawal that the world is quick to censure as moroseness. However, the necessity of sorting through one’s own contradictions requires a stillness that the bustle of a busy household cannot afford. When prudence dictates one course and inclination another, the resulting friction produces a weariness of soul that only isolation can soothe. It is a delicate business to examine the motives of one’s own heart without the interference of a mother’s advice or a sister’s scrutiny. In the quietude of one’s own chamber, the masks of social convenience are laid aside, and the painful work of self-reconciliation begins. One discovers that the greatest challenge is not in pleasing others, but in achieving a state of peace with a conscience that refuses to be silenced by the mere appearance of propriety.",ai_styled,Jane Austen,"Isolation, Withdrawal, and Inner Conflict",0.6420454545454546,0.2857142857142857,6.5,0,0,0,12.762614942528739
"There is a peculiar species of misery reserved for those who, while surrounded by the most agreeable company, find their spirits perversely inclined toward the garden gate. To withdraw from a drawing-room is often interpreted as a slight against the hostess, yet the heart frequently demands a sanctuary that no amount of polite conversation can provide. One may sit with a perfectly composed countenance, nodding at the appropriate intervals of a neighbor’s tedious narrative, while the inner mind is engaged in a violent struggle between the duty of sociability and the craving for silence. This isolation is not born of a lack of affection for one’s fellows, but rather from a realization that the noise of the world often drowns out the necessary whispers of the soul. To be alone is to be oneself, a luxury seldom permitted to those whose lives are measured by the frequency of their invitations and the elegance of their curtsies.",ai_styled,Jane Austen,"Isolation, Withdrawal, and Inner Conflict",0.6751592356687898,0.225,9.0,0,0,0,15.86646153846154
"The human mind is a theater of constant and often invisible warfare, where the forces of inclination and judgment are perpetually at odds. When a person of any sensibility finds their desires in direct opposition to their better sense, the result is a most distressing state of inner conflict. Such a struggle is rarely conducted in the public eye; instead, it manifests as a sudden fondness for long, solitary walks and a marked indifference to the arrival of the post. It is a curious irony that the more one’s thoughts are in turmoil, the more one seeks the stillness of a private chamber, as if the walls themselves might offer the counsel that friends cannot. This withdrawal is frequently mistaken for pride or ill-humor by the unobservant, who fail to perceive that the most profound battles are those fought without a single witness, and that a quiet exterior often masks a heart in the midst of a revolution.",ai_styled,Jane Austen,"Isolation, Withdrawal, and Inner Conflict",0.65625,0.5,7.6,1,0,0,15.330202531645572
"It is often remarked that nothing is so conducive to a settled mind as the steady routine of a country life, yet even the most tranquil surroundings cannot prevent the intrusion of a restless spirit. To feel isolated in the midst of a crowded assembly is a trial of the highest order, requiring a degree of fortitude that few possess. One observes the gaiety of others with a mixture of envy and exhaustion, wondering at the ease with which they navigate the trifles of the day. This sense of detachment leads inevitably to a voluntary withdrawal, a retreat into the fortress of one’s own reflections where the demands of civility no longer apply. There is a certain safety in this seclusion, for it protects the individual from the judgment of a world that prizes animation above all else. However, the conflict remains: the heart longs for connection even as the mind seeks to bar the door against the potential for further disappointment.",ai_styled,Jane Austen,"Isolation, Withdrawal, and Inner Conflict",0.656441717791411,0.2727272727272727,8.0,0,0,0,13.878271604938273
"A disposition toward melancholy is seldom viewed with favor by those who consider a cheerful temper to be the primary virtue of a companion. When an individual chooses to sequester themselves from the usual rounds of visits and balls, the neighborhood is quick to assign a motive, usually one involving a secret attachment or a failure of fortune. Yet the true cause is often far more complex, rooted in a profound inner conflict that defies easy explanation. To withdraw is to invite the scrutiny of the curious, who cannot conceive of a person finding more satisfaction in their own company than in the gossip of the tea table. It is a delicate balance to maintain one’s integrity while navigating the expectations of society; to be too solitary is to be thought eccentric, while to be too social is to risk losing that clarity of thought which only isolation can provide.

It is a singular irony that the more one is pressed to join in the general merriment, the more one feels the walls of their own reserve thickening.

"A person of any sensibility must occasionally find that their greatest enemy resides within the very breast they are taught to govern with such composure. To be at variance with oneself is a condition far more exhausting than any public disagreement, for there is no mediator to be found in the privacy of one’s own chamber. When the judgment dictates one course and the feelings another, the resulting withdrawal is less a choice than a refuge. One retreats into a shell of silence, not from a desire to be mysterious, but from the sheer impossibility of explaining a conflict that has no name. The world observes a quiet countenance and labels it pride or perhaps a touch of the headache, little suspecting that a tempest of indecision is currently overturning every settled principle of the soul.

"It is often remarked that solitude is the nurse of wisdom, yet in a society where every hour is mapped by visits and every thought is expected to be shared, the pursuit of it is viewed as a most suspicious eccentricity. To withdraw from the common gaze is to invite the most imaginative censures of one’s acquaintances, who are never so industrious as when they are interpreting the motives of a person who prefers their own company. Yet, there is a certain safety in this isolation; it protects the delicate machinery of the mind from the constant friction of trivialities. The inner conflict arises when the desire for peace clashes with the terror of being forgotten. One wishes to be left to their reflections, yet feels a pang of resentment when the world obligingly complies. It is a delicate balance to maintain—to be sufficiently apart to preserve one’s integrity, yet sufficiently present to avoid the reputation of a hermit or, worse, a bore.",ai_styled,Jane Austen,"Isolation, Withdrawal, and Inner Conflict",0.6097560975609756,0.34285714285714286,7.166666666666667,1,0,1,14.406226993865037
"There is no greater trial for a person of refined feeling than the necessity of maintaining a cheerful aspect when the heart is in a state of absolute rebellion. To withdraw to one’s dressing-room under the pretext of a fatigue that is more mental than physical is a stratagem as old as civilization itself. This self-imposed exile provides a temporary truce in the war between social expectation and private distress. Within those four walls, the mask of civility may be dropped, and the internal struggle may be viewed with the gravity it deserves. However, the relief is often short-lived, for the mind is a restless companion in isolation. One begins to reproach oneself for a lack of fortitude, and the very silence that was sought becomes a mirror reflecting every doubt and inconsistency. Thus, the withdrawal intended to bring peace only serves to intensify the conflict, proving that one cannot escape oneself simply by closing a door.",ai_styled,Jane Austen,"Isolation, Withdrawal, and Inner Conflict",0.6894409937888198,0.3333333333333333,7.142857142857143,0,0,0,12.397907188353049

"The decision to retreat from the world is seldom the result of a sudden whim, but rather the slow accumulation of those small, stinging disappointments that characterize a social existence. When the mind is at variance with itself, the most splendid assembly offers no consolation; indeed, the brightness of the candles only serves to illuminate one’s internal gloom. A person of any sensibility must occasionally find that their own thoughts are far more turbulent companions than the most vexatious of cousins. This withdrawal is not always an act of misanthropy, though the world is quick to label it as such. It is, more often, a necessary fortification against the clamor of conflicting desires. To weigh one’s inclinations against the demands of prudence is a solitary labor, performed in the quiet of a dressing-room or during a lonely walk across the shrubbery. In such moments, the soul is its own judge and jury, and the verdict—whether to rejoin the dance or remain in the shadows—is reached with a gravity that would astonish those who see only a quiet face and a folded fan.",ai_styled,Jane Austen,"Isolation, Withdrawal, and Inner Conflict",0.654054054054054,0.391304347826087,6.142857142857143,1,0,2,13.481868131868133
"It is often remarked that a quiet disposition is the hallmark of a contented mind, yet how frequently does a tranquil exterior mask a spirit in the throes of a most unquiet revolution. To withdraw from the bustle of the neighborhood is to invite the censure of every lady with a spare afternoon and a taste for speculation. They cannot conceive that a person might prefer their own company to the latest intelligence regarding a neighbor’s carriage or a niece’s prospects. Yet, the inner conflict that necessitates such isolation is a burden of considerable weight. One must navigate the treacherous waters between what is expected by society and what is required for one’s own peace. This withdrawal is a silent protest against the exhaustion of constant civility. The mind, weary of performing its part in the grand comedy of manners, seeks a refuge where it need not smile when it is vexed, nor speak when it is hollow.

"There is a certain dignity in withdrawal which the world, in its haste to be entertained, rarely pauses to admire. When a heart is divided against itself, the most elegant parlor becomes a cage, and the most polite conversation a series of obstacles to be surmounted with wearying fortitude. To seek the solitude of one’s own chamber is often the only means of preserving a semblance of propriety when the internal storm threatens to break. This isolation is a sanctuary for the soul’s most difficult negotiations, where the dictates of reason must contend with the impulses of a wounded sensibility. It is a curious truth that we are never so much at war as when we are alone, for then the pretenses of social grace are stripped away, leaving only the stark reality of our own contradictions. The conflict between who we are and who we must appear to be is a struggle that admits no witnesses.

One may sit with the most exemplary posture, offering the expected affirmations, while the soul is engaged in a silent, desperate struggle against the very civilities it is compelled to perform. This isolation, though invisible to the casual observer, is far more profound than any physical seclusion.

"A young person of sensitive disposition often discovers that the world is a place of much noise and very little consequence. In such instances, the sanctuary of one’s own chamber becomes not merely a preference, but a necessity for the preservation of one’s temper. There is a certain dignity in withdrawal, a belief that by removing oneself from the theater of social competition, one might achieve a state of rational tranquility. However, the mind is a treacherous companion in solitude. Without the diversion of external follies, it turns its scrutiny inward, dissecting every past conversation and imagined slight with a vigor that would be better spent on a useful embroidery. The conflict arises when the peace one sought in isolation proves to be a battlefield of self-reproach.

The struggle is not merely between solitude and society, but between the person one is expected to be and the person one truly is when the candles are extinguished.

This withdrawal, however, is rarely the peaceful retirement it promises to be. Instead, it fosters a peculiar inner conflict where the desire for connection battles with the fear of being misunderstood. The walls built for protection soon become the boundaries of a prison, and the mind, deprived of the tempering influence of society, grows increasingly eccentric in its conclusions. To be isolated by choice is a luxury that few can afford without paying a heavy price in spirits. One finds that the most rigorous self-examination, conducted in the absence of a friend’s perspective, leads only to a labyrinth of doubt.
